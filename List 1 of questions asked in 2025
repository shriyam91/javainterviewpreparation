Your Query (Get Top 3 Salaries per Department):
SELECT * FROM (
SELECT e.*,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rn
FROM employee e
)
WHERE rn <= 3;
􊺎􊺌􊺍 What this query does:
Step 1: ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)
This is a window function, and it assigns a unique rank number to each row within a
group (partition).
 PARTITION BY dept_id: Resets the row numbering for each department.
 ORDER BY salary DESC: Assigns row numbers starting from highest salary in
each department.
Step 2: Wrapping it in a subquery
You get a result like this:
emp_id name dept_id salary rn
101 Raj 10 90000 1
105 Priya 10 85000 2
109 Kiran 10 84000 3
203 Aman 20 87000 1
208 Seema 20 86000 2
... ... ... ... ...
Step 3: WHERE rn <= 3
Filters the result to include only the top 3 rows per department.
􋬗􋬘 Why can't we use GROUP BY directly?
Because GROUP BY:
 Reduces rows — gives one row per group, not multiple.
 You can’t get the top 3 employees per department with GROUP BY alone.
For example:
SELECT dept_id, MAX(salary)
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept_id;
This gives only 1 salary per department, not top 3.
􋯆 So, what about PARTITION BY?
Feature GROUP BY PARTITION BY (Window Function)
Rows Returned 1 row per group All rows are preserved
Usage Aggregation Ranking, running totals, etc.
Can get top N? 􎆡 No 􈄥􍿁 Yes (with ROW_NUMBER, RANK, etc.)
􊴘􊴙􊴚􊴛􊶨􊶩􊶪􊶫􊶬 Summary:
 􈄥􍿁 Use PARTITION BY with window functions to preserve rows and rank them
within groups.
 􎆡 GROUP BY is for aggregating data — not for ranking multiple rows within a
group.
Let me know if you want the same using RANK() (to handle ties) or DENSE_RANK() (for
more accurate group-wise ranking with ties).
You said:
DELETE FROM employee e WHERE ROWID NOT IN ( SELECT MIN(ROWID) FROM
employee GROUP BY name, dept_id ); expain
ChatGPT said:
Great! This query is a classic method to remove duplicate records from a table (in this
case, employee) based on certain columns — here name and dept_id — while keeping
only one copy of each duplicate.
Let’s break it down clearly.
􊺎􊺌􊺍 What does this query do?
DELETE FROM employee e
WHERE ROWID NOT IN (
SELECT MIN(ROWID)
FROM employee
GROUP BY name, dept_id
);
􈄥􍿁 Objective:
Remove duplicate rows (based on name and dept_id) from the employee table and
keep only one copy of each duplicate combination.
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Key Concepts Used:
􊼡 ROWID:
 A unique ID that Oracle assigns to every row physically stored in a table.
 It allows you to uniquely identify each row even if the data is identical.
 Fast and useful for row-level operations.
􊼡 GROUP BY name, dept_id:
 Groups the rows based on duplicate name and dept_id combinations.
􊼡 MIN(ROWID):
 For each group, it picks the row with the lowest ROWID — this is the row you
want to keep.
􍮏􍮍􍮎 How the Query Works:
1. SELECT MIN(ROWID) FROM employee GROUP BY name, dept_id
→ This returns the "first" row (physically) for every unique combination of name
and dept_id.
2. DELETE FROM employee e WHERE ROWID NOT IN (...)
→ Deletes all rows whose ROWID is NOT in the list above (i.e., the duplicates).
􈄥􍿁 Example:
Suppose your table employee contains:
ROWID name dept_id salary
AA1 John 10 50000
AA2 John 10 50000
AA3 John 20 60000
AA4 Mary 10 70000
AA5 Mary 10 70000
Now:
 For John, 10 → keep AA1, delete AA2
 For Mary, 10 → keep AA4, delete AA5
 John, 20 → no duplicate, keep it
After the delete, only unique (name, dept_id) pairs remain.
􎁏􎁐􎁑 Important Notes:
 Works only in Oracle, because only Oracle has ROWID.
 You can replace name, dept_id with any combination of columns you want to deduplicate.
 If you want to include more precise duplicates (e.g., same name, dept, and
salary), just group by those columns too.
􍬅􍬆􍬈􍬇􍬉􍬊􍬋 Optional: Always take a backup first!
CREATE TABLE employee_backup AS SELECT * FROM employee;
Let me know if you want the same logic for MySQL or PostgreSQL, which don’t support
ROWID.

ChatGPT said:
Let’s go through each of these PL/SQL and Performance-related Oracle interview
questions in detail:
􊶀􊶓􊶂􊶃 6. PL/SQL Concepts
􈄥􍿁 1. What are TRIGGERS? How are they di􀆯erent from PROCEDURES?
􊼡 TRIGGER:
 A block of PL/SQL code that automatically executes in response to a DML event
(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a table or view.
 Used for auditing, enforcement of business rules, synchronizing tables, etc.
􊼡 PROCEDURE:
 A named PL/SQL block that is stored in the database and must be explicitly
called.
 Can accept parameters (IN, OUT, IN OUT).
Feature Trigger Procedure
Execution Implicit (auto on DML/event) Explicit (manual call required)
Parameters 􎆡 No 􈄥􍿁 Yes
Feature Trigger Procedure
Use case Audit, validation, logging Encapsulate logic for reuse
􈄥􍿁 2. What is a CURSOR and how do you use it?
A cursor is a pointer to the context area for executing a SQL query. It is used to fetch
and process rows one at a time, especially useful when the result set returns multiple
rows.
􊼡 Two Types:
 Implicit Cursor: Used for simple SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
 Explicit Cursor: Declared manually when multiple-row processing is needed
􊼡 Example of Explicit Cursor:
DECLARE
CURSOR emp_cursor IS
SELECT emp_id, name FROM employee WHERE dept_id = 10;
v_emp_id employee.emp_id%TYPE;
v_name employee.name%TYPE;
BEGIN
OPEN emp_cursor;
LOOP
FETCH emp_cursor INTO v_emp_id, v_name;
EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('ID: ' || v_emp_id || ', Name: ' || v_name);
END LOOP;
CLOSE emp_cursor;
END;
􈄥􍿁 3. What is the di􀆯erence between an EXCEPTION and a TRIGGER?
Feature Exception Trigger
Purpose
Handle runtime errors in PL/SQL
blocks
Automatically execute code on
events
Use To control flow during errors To enforce rules, audit changes
Control Flow Catches errors within a program Reacts to external DML operations
Manual/Auto Manual (in code)
Automatic (on DML or system
events)
􈄥􍿁 4. How do you declare and use a PL/SQL function?
A function is a PL/SQL block that returns a value and can be used in SQL queries.
􊼡 Example:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_bonus (p_salary NUMBER)
RETURN NUMBER
IS
v_bonus NUMBER;
BEGIN
v_bonus := p_salary * 0.10;
RETURN v_bonus;
END;
􊼡 Use in SQL:
SELECT name, get_bonus(salary) FROM employee;
􈄥􍿁 5. What is the di􀆯erence between PROCEDURE and FUNCTION?
Feature Procedure Function
Returns a value 􎆡 No (can use OUT params) 􈄥􍿁 Yes (always returns a value)
Feature Procedure Function
Used in SQL? 􎆡 No 􈄥􍿁 Yes (can be used in SELECT, etc.)
Invocation Called from PL/SQL block Called from PL/SQL or SQL
Purpose Perform action Compute and return value
􊶀􊶔􊶂􊶃 7. Indexes & Performance
􈄥􍿁 6. What is the di􀆯erence between Clustered and Non-Clustered Index?
Note: Oracle does not have "clustered index" like SQL Server. Oracle uses indexorganized
tables (IOTs) instead.
Type Description
B-tree Index*
Default index in Oracle. Balanced, tree-structured. Fast on
large datasets.
Index-Organized Table
(IOT)
A table where the data is stored in index order (like clustered
index).
Bitmap Index Stores bitmap (0s and 1s); used in low-cardinality columns.
􈄥􍿁 7. How does an index improve performance?
 Speeds up data retrieval by avoiding full table scans
 Uses a tree-like structure (B-tree)* to search e􀆯iciently
 Helps in:
o WHERE clauses
o JOIN conditions
o ORDER BY, GROUP BY
o Foreign key constraints
􈄥􍿁 8. When should you avoid using an index?
 On columns with low cardinality (e.g., gender, boolean) → unless using a bitmap
index
 On small tables (Oracle may prefer a full scan)
 On columns that are frequently updated → can cause overhead
 If the query returns most rows → full scan may be better
􈄥􍿁 9. How to see the execution plan in Oracle?
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE dept_id = 10;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY);
You can also run:
SET AUTOTRACE ON;
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE dept_id = 10;
Requires correct privileges.
􈄥􍿁 10. ROWNUM vs ROWID
Feature ROWNUM ROWID
Meaning Pseudocolumn for row sequence Physical memory address of the row
Changes? Yes, changes with query ordering No, unique for each row (unless deleted)
Usage Pagination (e.g., ROWNUM <= 5) Precise row operations (e.g., deletes)
Let me know if you'd like real-time query examples, performance tuning tricks, or a
practice mock test next!
You said:
Stream<Integer> s1 = alist.stream();//consider alist is initialized List<Integer> l1=
s1.sorted().filter(s->s%2==0).skip(4).filter(s->s%3==0).collect(Collectors.toList());
s1.distinct().collect(Collectors.toList()); s1.filter(s->s%2==0).collect(Collectors.toList());
find what is wrong in it
ChatGPT said:
The main issue here is that Java streams can only be consumed once — once you’ve
performed a terminal operation (like collect, forEach, count, etc.), the stream is closed
and can’t be reused.
Let’s break down your code:
Stream<Integer> s1 = alist.stream(); // Create stream from alist
// First usage of s1 (Terminal Operation: collect)
List<Integer> l1 = s1
.sorted()
.filter(s -> s % 2 == 0)
.skip(4)
.filter(s -> s % 3 == 0)
.collect(Collectors.toList());
// Second usage of s1 (Invalid — s1 is already consumed above)
s1.distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());
// Third usage of s1 (Invalid again)
s1.filter(s -> s % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
What’s wrong?
1. s1 is consumed the moment you call
2. .collect(Collectors.toList())
in the first statement.
A consumed stream cannot be reused — doing so throws:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed
3. Streams are not data structures — they don’t store elements, they process
them in a pipeline, and once that pipeline finishes, the data is gone unless you
collected it.
How to fix it?
If you need to perform multiple operations, you must create a new stream each time
from the source:
List<Integer> l1 = alist.stream()
.sorted()
.filter(s -> s % 2 == 0)
.skip(4)
.filter(s -> s % 3 == 0)
.collect(Collectors.toList());
List<Integer> distinctList = alist.stream()
.distinct()
.collect(Collectors.toList());
List<Integer> evenList = alist.stream()
.filter(s -> s % 2 == 0)
.collect(Collectors.toList());
􊲃􊲄􊲅􊲆􊲇 Key takeaway:
A Stream in Java is single-use — once a terminal operation is called, you must recreate
it if you want to run another operation.
If you want, I can explain why streams are designed this way and what’s the
di􀆯erence between an intermediate and a terminal operation so this never confuses
you again.

what is head http method in sb, how it is di􀆯 from get
ChatGPT said:
In Spring Boot (and HTTP in general):
HEAD HTTP Method
 Purpose: Same as GET, but does not return the response body — only the
headers (metadata).
 It's like asking: "Hey server, what would you give me if I asked for this resource —
but don’t actually send the resource itself."
 Used mainly for:
o Checking if a resource exists (without downloading it)
o Checking metadata like Content-Length, Last-Modified, or ETag for
caching
Di􀆯erence between HEAD and GET
Feature GET HEAD
Response
Body
Yes, it includes the
actual data
No, only response headers are sent
Purpose
Retrieve and display the
resource
Check resource availability/metadata without
downloading
Bandwidth
Uses more (body +
headers)
Uses less (headers only)
Caching Can be cached Can also be cached (headers-based)
In Spring Boot
@RestController
public class MyController {
@GetMapping("/data")
public String getData() {
return "This is the GET response";
}
@RequestMapping(value = "/data", method = RequestMethod.HEAD)
public void headData(HttpServletResponse response) {
response.setHeader("Custom-Header", "SomeValue");
// No body is sent here
}
}
If you don’t explicitly define a HEAD mapping, Spring automatically supports it for any
GET endpoint — by just omitting the body.
􊲃􊲄􊲅􊲆􊲇 Key point: In Spring Boot, a HEAD request to a @GetMapping endpoint will return
only headers by default — you don’t need to write separate logic unless you want to
customize headers.
If you want, I can show how browsers and Postman behave di􀆯erently when you call
a HEAD method so you can see the real-world di􀆯erence.
You said:
yes please
ChatGPT said:
Alright, here’s how HEAD vs GET behaves in practice, step-by-step, so you can see the
di􀆯erence clearly.
􈄥􈄩 In Spring Boot
@RestController
public class MyController {
@GetMapping("/hello")
public String getHello() {
return "Hello World!";
}
}
(No separate HEAD method — Spring Boot will automatically handle it if you send a
HEAD request.)
􈄥􈄪 Testing in Postman / Browser
Case 1: GET Request
 Request:
 GET http://localhost:8080/hello
 Response Headers:
 Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
 Content-Length: 12
 Date: Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:20:00 GMT
 Response Body:
 Hello World!
Case 2: HEAD Request
 Request:
 HEAD http://localhost:8080/hello
 Response Headers (same as GET):
 Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
 Content-Length: 12
 Date: Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:20:05 GMT
 Response Body:
 [empty]
􊲃􊲄􊲅􊲆􊲇 You see Content-Length = 12 means that if you had done a GET, the server would
have sent 12 bytes — but HEAD skips sending them.
􈄥􈄫 In Browser
Browsers rarely let you directly make a HEAD request, but you can see them:
 In Chrome DevTools → Network tab
 Many sites use HEAD internally for:
o Checking resource availability before GET (e.g., caching, redirects)
o Preflight requests in some APIs
􈄥􈄬 Why It Matters
 Performance: HEAD avoids sending the body — faster for checking large files.
 SEO/Monitoring: Search engines, uptime monitors use HEAD to verify a page
exists without downloading it.
 APIs: HEAD can be used for lightweight status checks.
If you want, I can show you a Spring Boot example where GET returns a big file, and
HEAD just gives metadata, so you can measure the speed di􀆯erence. That’s where
HEAD really shines.
You said:
can we use only a try with finally and without using catch, and what will happen if there
is a exception inside the catch
ChatGPT said:
Yes — in Java you can have try with finally without catch.
􈄥􈄩 try + finally without catch
Example:
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
System.out.println("Inside try");
int x = 10 / 0; // Exception here
} finally {
System.out.println("Inside finally");
}
}
}
Output:
Inside try
Inside finally
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
􈄥􍿁 What happens:
 The finally block always runs, even if there is an exception.
 But since there is no catch, the exception is not handled and propagates up the
call stack after finally executes.
􈄥􈄪 Exception inside catch
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
int x = 10 / 0; // Will cause ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
System.out.println("In catch");
int y = 5 / 0; // Exception inside catch
} finally {
System.out.println("In finally");
}
}
}
Output:
In catch
In finally
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
􈄥􍿁 What happens:
 The original exception (10 / 0) is replaced by the new one from inside catch.
 finally still runs.
 The new exception propagates upward (unless handled somewhere else).
􊲃􊲄􊲅􊲆􊲇 If you want to preserve the original exception and throw another one, you’d have to
wrap it or rethrow both — Java doesn’t natively keep two active exceptions without
manual handling.
If you want, I can show you how to keep both exceptions using
Throwable.addSuppressed() — it’s a neat trick interviewers sometimes ask about.
You said:
can we use only a try with finally and without using catch, and what will happen if there
is a exception inside the try and since catch is not present to handle the exception so
what will happen
ChatGPT said:
Yes — Java allows you to have a try with finally without a catch block.
􈄥􈄩 Using only try + finally
Example:
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
System.out.println("Inside try");
int x = 10 / 0; // Exception here
} finally {
System.out.println("Inside finally");
}
}
}
What happens:
1. The try block starts executing.
2. An exception occurs (/ by zero).
3. Java immediately checks for a catch — there is none.
4. Before leaving the method, the finally block is always executed.
5. After finally finishes, the exception is thrown to the caller (program crashes if
not handled there).
Output:
Inside try
Inside finally
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
So, the finally block still runs, but the exception is not handled and propagates up.
􈄥􈄪 Why would you do this?
 Sometimes you want to ensure cleanup (e.g., closing files, releasing locks) but
let exceptions bubble up.
 This is common in low-level libraries, where the method doesn’t want to
swallow exceptions.
If you want, I can also show what changes when you add a catch and how suppressed
exceptions work if another exception occurs in finally.
You said:
please respond
ChatGPT said:
Yes — you can absolutely use try with finally without a catch.
􈄥􈄩 What happens if there’s an exception in the try (no catch)
Example:
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
System.out.println("Inside try");
int x = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException
} finally {
System.out.println("Inside finally");
}
}
}
Execution flow:
1. try block starts.
2. Exception occurs (ArithmeticException here).
3. No catch — Java still executes the finally block.
4. After finally, the exception is propagated to the caller.
5. If no higher-level catch exists, the program terminates with an error.
Output:
Inside try
Inside finally
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
􈄥􈄪 Why finally runs even without catch
 Java guarantees that finally executes for cleanup code (closing files, releasing
resources).
 Even if an exception occurs, it will run before control leaves the method.
􈄥􈄫 If another exception occurs inside finally
If the finally block itself throws an exception, it overrides the original exception from try.
Example:
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
int x = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException
} finally {
String s = null;
s.length(); // NullPointerException
}
}
}
Here, the NullPointerException from finally will be the one reported — the original
ArithmeticException is lost unless you manually handle it.
If you want, I can show you how to keep both exceptions using suppressed exceptions,
which is something interviewers love to ask.
You said:
and If no exception is there in try block and we are returning some output in try block
and then also returning a di􀆯erent output in finally block , so which output will get
returned
ChatGPT said:
Ah — that’s a classic Java gotcha!
If you return from both try and finally, the return in finally will override the one in try,
even if there’s no exception.
Example
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(method());
}
static int method() {
try {
return 1;
} finally {
return 2;
}
}
}
Output:
2
Why this happens
 When a return is hit inside try, Java remembers the value to return.
 But before actually returning to the caller, it executes finally.
 If finally has its own return, it replaces the stored value.
Best practice
Avoid using return in finally — it’s confusing and can hide bugs.
Instead, do cleanup in finally and let try or catch decide the return.
If you want, I can show you step-by-step bytecode execution for this so you see
exactly how the override happens. That’s something interviewers love when you explain
in detail.
You said:
di􀆯erence b/w post and patch
ChatGPT said:
Alright — let’s go deep into POST vs PATCH in REST APIs, especially how they behave in
HTTP and Spring Boot.
􈄥􈄩 Purpose
Aspect POST PATCH
Goal
Create a new resource or submit
data to the server.
Partially update an existing
resource.
Idempotency
􎆡 Not idempotent by default
(multiple POSTs may create
multiple resources).
􈄥􍿁 Ideally idempotent (same PATCH
request repeated should give same
result).
Operation
Sends complete data for creation.
Can also be used to replace if API
supports.
Sends only the fields that need to be
updated — partial modification.
􈄥􈄪 Request Semantics
 POST
o Tells the server: "Here’s some new data — store it, assign an ID, and return
it to me"
o Used for creation, file uploads, form submissions, etc.
o Example:
o POST /users
o Content-Type: application/json
o
o {
o "name": "John Doe",
o "email": "john@example.com"
o }
 PATCH
o Tells the server: "Here’s the change I want for this resource — apply it
without replacing everything"
o More e􀆯icient for updates when only a few fields change.
o Example:
o PATCH /users/123
o Content-Type: application/json
o
o {
o "email": "newemail@example.com"
o }
􈄥􈄫 Behavior in Spring Boot
 POST Mapping
 @PostMapping("/users")
 public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
 return userRepository.save(user);
 }
 PATCH Mapping
 @PatchMapping("/users/{id}")
 public User updateUserPartially(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody
Map<String, Object> updates) {
 User user = userRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow();
 if (updates.containsKey("email")) {
 user.setEmail((String) updates.get("email"));
 }
 return userRepository.save(user);
 }
􈄥􈄬 Key Di􀆯erences
Feature POST PATCH
Use case Create resource or submit data Update part of an existing resource
Request Body Usually full object Only fields to be updated
Idempotent No Yes (if implemented correctly)
Safe No No
Response Code 201 Created (for creation) 200 OK or 204 No Content
􊲃􊲄􊲅􊲆􊲇 Quick tip for interviews:
If you’re updating entire resource, use PUT.
If you’re partially updating, use PATCH.
If you’re creating, use POST.
If you want, I can also give you a real-world example comparing POST, PUT, and
PATCH for the same resource so you see all three in action. That makes it easier to
remember in interviews.
You said:
Stream<Integer> s1 = alist.stream(); // Create stream from alist // First usage of s1
(Terminal Operation: collect) List<Integer> l1 = s1 .sorted() .filter(s -> s % 2 == 0) .skip(4)
.filter(s -> s % 3 == 0) .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Second usage of s1 (Invalid — s1 is
already consumed above) s1.distinct().collect(Collectors.toList()); // Third usage of s1
(Invalid again) so in the above code it will give runtime or compile time error
ChatGPT said:
It will give a runtime error, not a compile-time error.
In Java Streams:
 A stream can only be consumed once because terminal operations (like
collect(), forEach(), reduce()) close the stream.
 If you try to reuse the same stream variable after a terminal operation, you get:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 In your code:
List<Integer> l1 = s1
.sorted()
.filter(s -> s % 2 == 0)
.skip(4)
.filter(s -> s % 3 == 0)
.collect(Collectors.toList()); // <-- consumes s1
s1.distinct().collect(Collectors.toList()); // <-- causes runtime error
􈄥􍿁 Fix → Create a new stream each time:
alist.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());
If you want, I can explain why streams are designed to be one-time use only.
You said:
hey just like you previously gave me interview questions on java and sql, now can use
give me list of important interview questions on " real time scenario questions on
microservices"
ChatGPT said:
Got it 􈄥􍿁 — you’re asking for real-time scenario-based microservices interview
questions, the kind that interviewers use to test practical, hands-on understanding, not
just definitions.
Here’s a comprehensive list (I’ve grouped them so it’s easier to digest):
1. Architecture & Design Scenarios
 You have 5 microservices, and one service’s response is slow, a􀆯ecting others.
How will you find the bottleneck and fix it?
 How would you design a microservices system that can handle spikes in tra􀆯ic
(e.g., flash sales)?
 If one microservice needs data from three other services, how will you design the
call flow to reduce latency?
 In your company, you’re migrating from a monolith to microservices. Which
services would you split first and why?
 How will you decide whether to use synchronous (REST) or asynchronous
(Kafka/Event-driven) communication between two services?
2. Communication & API Scenarios
 Service A calls Service B, but Service B returns errors intermittently. How
would you prevent Service A from failing?
 How do you handle versioning of APIs when multiple clients consume your
microservices?

Alright — here’s a 2-in-1 list of real-time microservices scenario interview questions
that will test both practical thinking and architectural problem-solving.
I’ll break it into Beginner-to-Mid level and Advanced/Architectural level, so you can
prepare progressively.
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Real-Time Microservices Scenario Questions — Beginner to Mid Level
(These focus on practical development and debugging situations you’d face day-to-day.)
1. Service Down Issue
o One of your microservices is failing with 500 errors, but logs are showing
"timeout connecting to DB". How will you debug and fix it without
downtime?
2. Data Consistency Problem
o Order service confirms an order, but Payment service shows payment
failed due to network delay. How would you handle this so data is
consistent?
3. Circuit Breaker Scenario
o Product service is slow due to a dependent service delay. How would you
use Resilience4j/Hystrix to prevent cascading failures?
4. Version Compatibility
o You deployed a new version of a service that breaks API compatibility for
other services. How do you fix it without rolling back?
5. Message Duplication in Kafka
o A consumer is processing the same Kafka message twice, causing
duplicate entries in DB. How will you fix it?
6. Database Per Service
o Why is having a single shared DB for all microservices considered a bad
practice? What’s the alternative and how to handle cross-service queries?
7. Service Discovery Issue
o In Eureka/Consul, your service is registered but other services cannot call
it. What might be wrong and how to troubleshoot?
8. Authentication Between Services
o How will you implement authentication & authorization between services
without making the client pass credentials to every service?
9. Long Running Processes
o In an order-processing flow, one step takes 2 minutes to complete. How
will you design it so that the client doesn’t wait that long?
10. Logging & Tracing
o In a distributed system, logs are scattered across services. How will you
track a single request end-to-end?
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Real-Time Microservices Scenario Questions — Advanced/Architectural
(These test your design thinking and handling of complex real-world challenges.)
1. Saga Pattern Implementation
o You have a 3-step process across multiple microservices. Step 2 fails.
How will you ensure rollback across all services?
2. Eventual Consistency vs Strong Consistency
o How will you decide between them in a payment system vs a social media
post system?
3. Blue-Green & Canary Deployment
o How do you deploy a new version of a critical service with zero downtime
and safe rollback?
4. API Gateway Design
o You have 15 microservices. How do you handle routing, authentication,
and rate-limiting e􀆯iciently?
5. Bulkhead Pattern
o How will you design your system so that if one microservice is overloaded,
it doesn’t crash others?
6. Distributed Transactions Without 2PC
o Since 2PC (two-phase commit) is slow, how will you achieve transaction
management across services?
7. Dead Letter Queue in Kafka/RabbitMQ
o What is it, when do you use it, and how do you avoid infinite retries?
8. Service Communication Choice
o Given a new requirement, how will you decide between synchronous
REST, gRPC, or asynchronous messaging?
9. Database Sharding and Scaling
o Your microservice DB is becoming a bottleneck. How will you design
sharding and ensure service availability during scaling?
10. Resiliency Testing (Chaos Engineering)
o How will you test your system’s fault tolerance in production without
breaking it?
If you want, I can make detailed answers with diagrams and code snippets for these,
so they become ready-to-use interview prep notes.
That would make them not just a question bank but a practical playbook.

Thought for 4 seconds
Great — I’ll answer the first 5 real-time microservices scenarios from the
beginner/mid list with practical steps, patterns, and small examples you can mention in
an interview.
1) Service failing with timeout connecting to DB — how to debug & fix without
downtime
Quick diagnosis steps
1. Check service logs & metrics (connection pool errors, stack traces).
2. Check DB health/metrics (CPU, connections, slow queries, max connections).
3. Check connection pool config (maxPoolSize, minIdle, connectionTimeout).
4. Check network (latency, firewall, DNS) between app pods and DB.
5. Check recent deploys/config changes (driver upgrade, TLS, credentials).
Common causes
 Connection pool exhausted (too small or leaks).
 DB reached max_connections.
 Long-running queries/locks causing wait_timeouts.
 Network partition or DNS issues.
 Authentication/credential rotation failure.
Fixes you can apply safely (without downtime)
 Increase pool size temporarily or tune timeouts (in Spring Boot application.yml
or datasource config).
 Enable/scale read-replicas or use a connection-proxy/load-balancer (e.g.,
PgBouncer).
 Kill/resolve blocking queries (DB admin).
 Add circuit breaker / bulkhead so callers get fast failures instead of cascading
timeouts.
 Add connection validation (test-on-borrow) to avoid handing out stale
connections.
 If config was wrong, roll forward with corrected config via config server (Spring
Cloud Config) — rolling restart pods (K8s Deployment rolling update) keeps
service available.
Things to mention in interview
 Use health checks (liveness/readiness) so K8s takes unhealthy pod out of
rotation.
 Look at metrics: DB connections, pool usage, query latency
(Prometheus/Grafana).
 Use read-only replicas for read-heavy workloads; o􀆯load analytics queries.
 Add timeouts and retries with backo􀆯 to avoid overload.
2) Order confirmed but Payment shows failed due to network delay — how to
ensure consistency
Problem type: distributed transaction / eventual consistency.
Options / Patterns
1. Saga pattern (preferred): break the transaction into local transactions with
compensating actions.
o Two flavors: Choreography (services emit events) or Orchestration
(central saga orchestrator).
o Example flow (Orchestrator):
1. OrderService creates ORDER_PENDING.
2. Orchestrator calls PaymentService → if success, Orchestrator
marks ORDER_CONFIRMED.
3. If Payment fails, Orchestrator calls OrderService to cancel
(compensating action).
2. Outbox + Event-driven: write the intent to DB and outbox in same local
transaction; separate process reads outbox and publishes events reliably to the
message broker.
o avoids lost events.
3. Idempotency & retries: make operations idempotent so retries don’t double
charge.
4. Two-phase commit (2PC) — usually avoided in microservices due to coupling
and performance.
Practical approach
 Use OrderStatus = PENDING until Payment confirms.
 Implement compensation for partial failures (refunds, cancel order).
 Use at-least-once messaging with dedup keys and idempotent consumers to
handle retries.
 Use timeouts and user-facing rollback (e.g., if payment takes > N seconds,
cancel automatically).
What to say in interview
 Explain Saga (give simple sequence), mention outbox pattern to ensure events
are published reliably, and emphasize idempotency and monitoring for stuck
orders.
3) Product service is slow due to dependent service — how to use circuit breaker
(Resilience4j/Hystrix) to prevent cascading failures
Intent: Prevent cascading failures and fail fast.
How circuit breaker helps
 Closed: let requests pass.
 Open: after threshold failures, short-circuit requests immediately (return
fallback).
 Half-open: periodically allow a small number of requests to test recovery.
Resilience4j (modern choice) — example (Spring Boot)
@CircuitBreaker(name = "productService", fallbackMethod = "productFallback")
public Product getProduct(long id) {
return restTemplate.getForObject("http://inventory-service/products/" + id,
Product.class);
}
public Product productFallback(long id, Throwable t) {
// return cached product or graceful default
return cachedProductService.getCachedProduct(id);
}
Complementary patterns
 Timeouts: set timeouts per call to avoid blocking threads.
 Retries with backo􀆯: but be careful to avoid retry storms.
 Bulkhead: isolate thread pools or connections per dependency so a slow
dependency doesn't exhaust resources.
 Fallbacks: cached data, degraded responses, or user-friendly messages.
What to mention
 Thresholds (failure rate & slow call rate) and retry/backo􀆯 strategies.
 Use metrics (Prometheus) and alerting when circuit opens frequently.
 Prefer Resilience4j now (lighter, modular) over Hystrix (obsolete).
4) New version breaks API compatibility — how to fix without rolling back
Immediate mitigation
1. Introduce compatibility layer in the service (accept old payloads and translate
to new model).
2. API Gateway route rules: route old clients to the previous version (if you kept v1
alive).
3. Use feature toggles to disable the problematic change quickly.
4. Deploy a small hotfix to restore backward-compatible behavior (prefer if safe).
Longer-term practices to avoid this
 API versioning (URI /v1/... or header-based) so old clients keep working.
 Backward-compatible changes only (additive changes like new optional
fields).
 Consumer-driven contract testing (Pact) so providers can run consumer tests
before deploy.
 Semantic versioning + CI checks for breaking changes.
Example steps to fix without full rollback
 If the change is a request format: add code to accept both formats and map
them.
 If response changed shape: preserve old fields until all consumers migrate.
 Communicate with teams/clients about deprecation timeline.
What to say in interview
 Emphasize contracts, incremental migration, and short-lived compatibility
bridges rather than immediate rollback as best practice.
5) Kafka consumer processing same message twice (duplicates) — how to fix
Why duplicates happen
 At-least-once delivery in Kafka by default. Consumer may process and fail before
committing o􀆯set, then re-process.
 Multiple producers retried can produce duplicates.
 Consumer crashes after processing but before commit.
Strategies to avoid duplicates
1. Idempotent processing:
o Make the consumer processing idempotent using a unique business-key
(orderId, messageId).
o Maintain a dedup store (DB table processed_message_ids with unique
constraint) to record processed IDs:
 INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING (or handle unique
constraint violation).
 Only process if insert succeeded.
2. Kafka exactly-once semantics (EOS):
o Use idempotent producer (enable.idempotence=true) and Kafka
transactions (producer + consumer within transaction) — supports
exactly-on
You said:
1. Architecture & Design Scenarios You have 5 microservices, and one service’s
response is slow, a􀆯ecting others. How will you find the bottleneck and fix it? How
would you design a microservices system that can handle spikes in tra􀆯ic (e.g., flash
sales)? If one microservice needs data from three other services, how will you design
the call flow to reduce latency? In your company, you’re migrating from a monolith to
microservices. Which services would you split first and why? How will you decide
whether to use synchronous (REST) or asynchronous (Kafka/Event-driven)
communication between two services?
ChatGPT said:
Nice — solid set of architecture questions. I’ll answer each one with practical steps,
patterns, trade-o􀆯s and short examples you can use in an interview.
1) One of 5 microservices is slow and it's a􀆯ecting others — how do you find the
bottleneck and fix it?
Diagnose (observe first)
 Check distributed tracing (Jaeger / Zipkin / OpenTelemetry) to see which service
+ span is slow.
 Check metrics (Prometheus/Grafana): request latency, p95/p99, error rate,
request rate.
 Inspect logs (correlate request-id across services).
 Check infrastructure metrics: CPU, GC, thread pools, DB connections, network
(pod/node).
 Capture thread dumps / heap dump if CPU/GC looks suspicious.
 Check DB slow query log, locks, long-running transactions.
Common root causes
 Downstream blocking (DB, external API)
 Saturated thread pool / event-loop / connection pool
 Expensive synchronous work in request path
 Network/DNS issues or heavy GC
 Bad query / missing index
Fixes
 If DB is slow → optimize query, add index, use read-replicas, caching (Redis), or
increase DB resources.
 If connection pool exhausted → increase pool size or reduce blocking time; add
backpressure.
 O􀆯load long work to async/background (message queue) so request returns
quickly.
 Apply circuit breaker + fallback to fail fast and prevent cascade.
 Add rate limiting / throttling and bulkhead to isolate resource usage.
 Horizontal scale the problematic service (K8s HPA) if CPU/IO bound.
What to say in interview
 Show you’d observe → isolate → mitigate → fix.
 Mention short-term mitigations (circuit breaker, increase pool, caching) + longterm
fixes (optimize code/queries, architectural changes).
2) Design a microservices system to handle spikes (flash sale)
Principles
 Make the system asynchronous where possible, apply backpressure, and
decouple components.
 Design for graceful degradation (show “sold out / try again” rather than
crashing).
 Pre-plan capacity, autoscale, and cache aggressively.
Architecture / tactics
 Queueing: Put incoming purchase requests into a message queue
(Kafka/RabbitMQ) so the backend consumes at sustainable rate.
 Rate limiting + throttling: API Gateway or service-level rate limits per IP / user.
 Token bucket / leaky bucket for smoothing bursts.
 Pre-warming / reserve inventory: Pre-allocate inventory tokens to avoid DB
contention.
 Optimistic concurrency with versioning or compare-and-set in DB; use UPDATE
... WHERE stock > 0 and check rows-a􀆯ected.
 Fast read path: Serve product page data from CDN/edge cache; use cache
warming.
 Idempotency: Ensure retries don’t charge twice (idempotency key).
 Backpressure + graceful responses: Return “in queue” or “try later” when
overloaded.
 Partitioning/sharding: Inventory partitioned by product or geography to avoid
hotspots.
 Database design: Use fast, write-optimized stores for counters (Redis, inmemory
counters), with a durable reconciliation to primary DB.
 Chaos testing and runbooks: Test spike scenarios and have rollback/playbook.
Example flow
1. Client hits API gateway → rate limiting + CAPTCHA if needed.
2. Request → enqueue to Kafka with order request + idempotency key.
3. Consumer(s) process queue at controlled rate, reserve inventory atomically,
publish result events.
4. Client polls or gets push notification when fulfilled.
3) If service A needs data from 3 services (B, C, D) — how to design call flow to
reduce latency?
Options & trade-o􀆯s
 Synchronous sequential calls (A → B → C → D): simplest, highest latency —
avoid.
 Parallel fan-out calls: A calls B,C,D concurrently and aggregates responses —
much lower latency.
 Aggregator / Composite service (or API Gateway with aggregation): a separate
layer that does the fan-out and composes responses.
 Cache / materialized view (CQRS): pre-aggregate data in a read model so A
queries one store.
 Backend-for-Frontend (BFF): tailor aggregated responses to clients
(mobile/desktop).
 GraphQL: allows client to fetch aggregated data in one request (server still may
fan-out).
 Event-driven denormalization: B/C/D publish events; A subscribes and
maintains local copy for low-latency reads.
Recommended approach
 Prefer parallel calls + timeouts + fallbacks:
o Use non-blocking/async clients (WebClient in Spring, gRPC async,
CompletableFuture) to call B,C,D in parallel.
o Apply timeouts and circuit breakers for each call.
o Provide partial responses or cached defaults when some services are
slow.
 If high read-volume and low-change, use denormalized read model
(materialized view) to avoid runtime fan-out.
Small Java example (parallel with CompletableFuture):
CompletableFuture<ResponseB> b = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> callB());
CompletableFuture<ResponseC> c = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> callC());
CompletableFuture<ResponseD> d = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> callD());
CompletableFuture.allOf(b,c,d).join();
aggregate(b.join(), c.join(), d.join());
(Use timeouts / exception handling and fallbacks.)
4) Migrating monolith to microservices — which services to split first and why?
Strategy: Strangler Fig + incremental migration. Don’t rip everything at once.
Choose candidates based on:
 High change rate / active development: modules that change often — extract
to enable faster independent deployment.
 Strongly cohesive bounded contexts: domain areas with clear boundaries
(e.g., Billing, Orders, Catalog).
 Scalability hotspots: parts of the monolith that need to scale independently
(search, checkout).
 Independent data/logic: modules that don’t heavily share DB with many other
modules.
 Risk and complexity: start with low-risk services that are small, wellunderstood,
and have few dependencies — build the pipeline and experience.
Typical first splits
 Auth / User management (well-contained, security-focused).
 Catalog / Product (read-heavy, caching-friendly).
 Payments / Billing (security, auditing, compliance).
 Notifications / Email (asynchronous, decoupled).
Steps
1. Map domain boundaries and dependencies (domain-driven design).
2. Extract read-only/sidecar features (reporting, notifications) first.
3. Introduce API gateway + routing to either monolith endpoints or new
microservices.
4. Implement the outbox pattern so events produced by the monolith are reliably
published.
5. Incrementally route tra􀆯ic to new service (canary/blue-green).
6. Clean up monolith once migration is validated.
What to mention in interview
 Use consumer-driven contract tests, one DB-per-service or carefully controlled
DB migration, monitoring, and rollback strategies.
5) How to decide between synchronous (REST) or asynchronous (Kafka/event)
between two services?
Decision criteria
1. Latency & user experience
o If the client needs an immediate response (synchronous user flow), use
sync or a hybrid: sync for acknowledgement + async for long work.
2. Coupling & availability
o If you need loose coupling or resilience to downtime, prefer async
(messages queue) — producer doesn’t block on consumer availability.
3. Consistency needs
o For strong consistency (immediate read-after-write), sync or distributed
transaction required (avoid if possible).
o For eventual consistency, async is fine.
4. Throughput
o High throughput / bursty workloads → async scales better.
5. Ordering / transactional semantics
o If ordering or transactional guarantees are needed, check broker
capabilities (Kafka partitions). For end-to-end transactions, consider
Saga.
6. Complexity & operational overhead
o Async introduces complexity: brokers, delivery semantics, deduplication,
monitoring.
o Sync is simpler but risks cascading failures and higher latency.
7. Use-case examples
o REST (sync): auth check during login, simple CRUD where immediate
result required.
o Kafka (async): order placed → inventory reserve, email notification,
analytics events.
Hybrid patterns
 Request-Reply over messaging for async with response.
 Eventual sync: accept client request (sync ack), enqueue background
processing, notify client when finished.
 Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): commands via async,
queries to denormalized read models.
Example rule-of-thumb
 If operation must be completed before responding (e.g., payment confirmation)
→ consider sync or synchronous orchestration; else async is preferable for
decoupling.
If you want, I can:
 Expand any single answer with a diagram.
 Provide code snippets (Spring Boot + Resilience4j, WebClient parallel calls,
Kafka producer/consumer) for real-world examples.
 Create a one-page cheat sheet you can use just before interviews.

ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’ve posted your controller and service code for sendNPARequest and
sendNPAdataRequest.
From a quick review, I can explain what’s happening, possible issues, and
improvements.
What your code does
1. Controller:
o Exposes a GET endpoint /sendNpaRequest returning JSON.
o Simply calls the service layer’s sendNPAdataRequest() and returns its
ResponseEntity.
2. Service:
o Fetches NPARequest records with a specific status code
(SHEDULER_REQUEST_STATUSCODE).
o If the list isn’t empty:
 Fetches two config values (npaRequestUrl and passphrase).
 Loops through each request:
 Logs request ID.
 Updates DB status to “processed”.
 Calls callNPARequest() (which likely sends the data to an
external API).
 Updates DB status to “success”.
o On success, returns an APIResponse with a success code and message.
o On exception:
 Logs error.
 Updates status to “failed” for the current reqId.
 Returns an APIResponse with a failed code and message.
Possible issues
1. Batch Processing Failures
o If one request fails, your current code stops and sets only that reqId as
failed.
If multiple fail, others may never get updated correctly.
o You might want to catch errors inside the loop to process remaining
requests.
2. Hard-coded sequential loop
o You’re calling callNPARequest() in a loop synchronously.
If the external API is slow, this delays everything.
o You could use parallel processing (e.g., CompletableFuture, parallel
streams, or async tasks) if performance matters.
3. Status Update Logic
o You’re marking requests as SHEDULER_PROCESSED before calling
callNPARequest().
If that fails, you’re overwriting the status to FAILED, but in between, it
could look like the request was processed.
o Better: mark it as “Processing” before calling, then mark “Success” or
“Failed” after completion.
4. Error Logging
o You’re logging only e with + string concatenation, which loses stack trace
formatting.
o Use log.error("Error in sendNPAdataRequest", e); instead.
5. Configuration Fetch
o You fetch npaRequestUrl and passphrase inside the loop even though
they’re constants for the batch.
o Move them outside the loop.
Improved Structure
Here’s a cleaned-up version:
@Override
public ResponseEntity<APIResponse> sendNPAdataRequest() {
String reqId = null;
APIResponse apiResponse;
String npaRequestUrl =
cGTMSCConfigurationsRepository.findByKey(AppConstants.CGTMSC_NPA_URL);
String passphrase =
cGTMSCConfigurationsRepository.findByKey(AppConstants.PASS_PHRASE);
try {
List<NPARequest> requests = nPARequestRepository
.findByStatusCode(AppConstants.SHEDULER_REQUEST_STATUSCODE);
if (CommonUtils.isListEmptyOrNull(requests)) {
return new ResponseEntity<>(
new APIResponse("No requests found",
SidbiStatus.SUCCESS.getStatusCode()),
HttpStatus.OK
);
}
log.info("Data fetched from NPARequest table -> size: {}", requests.size());
for (NPARequest request : requests) {
reqId = request.getReqId();
try {
log.info("Processing Request Id: {}", reqId);
nPARequestRepository.updateNPARequestStatusCode(
reqId, SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_PROCESSED.getStatusCode(),
CommonUtils.getCurrentDateAndTime(),
SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_PROCESSED.getStatusMsg()
);
callNPARequest(request, npaRequestUrl, passphrase);
nPARequestRepository.updateNPARequestStatusCode(
reqId, SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_SUCCESS.getStatusCode(),
CommonUtils.getCurrentDateAndTime(),
SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_SUCCESS.getStatusMsg()
);
} catch (Exception ex) {
log.error("Error processing Request Id: {}", reqId, ex);
nPARequestRepository.updateNPARequestStatusCode(
reqId, SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_FAILED.getStatusCode(),
CommonUtils.getCurrentDateAndTime(),
SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_FAILED.getStatusMsg()
);
}
}
apiResponse = new APIResponse(SidbiStatus.SUCCESS.getStatusMsg(),
SidbiStatus.SUCCESS.getStatusCode());
} catch (Exception e) {
log.error("Error in sendNPAdataRequest", e);
apiResponse = new APIResponse(SidbiStatus.FAILED.getStatusMsg(),
SidbiStatus.FAILED.getStatusCode());
}
return new ResponseEntity<>(apiResponse, HttpStatus.OK);
}
If you want, I can also optimize this for parallel processing so that if you have 100
requests, they can run in parallel instead of one by one. That will make it much faster
when the external API is slow.
Do you want me to make that parallel-processing version next?
You said:
@Modifying @Query(nativeQuery = false,value = "update NPARequest u set
u.statusCode =?2,u.requestSendDateTime=?3,u.shedulerMsg=?4 where u.reqId=?1")
void updateNPARequestStatusCode(String reqId, String statusCode, String
localDatetime, String message);
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’re showing me the JPA repository method for updating the NPARequest
record.
Looking at your code across controller → service → repository, here’s a quick
breakdown and some improvement suggestions:
What it’s doing now
 Controller: /sendNpaRequest triggers sendNPAdataRequest() in the service.
 Service:
o Fetches NPARequest records with a specific status code.
o For each record:
 Updates status to "processed"
 Calls an external API (callNPARequest)
 Updates status to "success"
o Catches exceptions and marks record as "failed".
 Repository: Uses a @Modifying JPQL query to update fields for a given reqId.
Concerns & Improvements
1. Transaction Boundaries
 You are making multiple updates (processed → success or processed → failed) in
separate DB calls for each record.
 If callNPARequest() fails midway, you have partial updates.
 􈄥􍿁 Suggestion: Wrap the entire record processing in a transactional boundary
but avoid holding the transaction while making an external API call. Instead:
o First mark record as "in progress"
o Commit
o Call external API
o Then update final status
@Transactional
public void markAsProcessed(String reqId, String message) {
nPARequestRepository.updateNPARequestStatusCode(reqId,
SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_PROCESSED.getStatusCode(),
CommonUtils.getCurrentDateAndTime(),
message);
}
2. Batch Processing Instead of Loop
 If the list of NPARequests is large, you’re doing multiple individual DB calls.
 􈄥􍿁 Suggestion: Use saveAll for bulk updates or batch update queries.
 Example for bulk "processed" update:
@Modifying
@Query("UPDATE NPARequest u SET u.statusCode = :statusCode WHERE u.reqId IN
:reqIds")
void updateMultipleStatus(@Param("reqIds") List<String> reqIds,
@Param("statusCode") String statusCode);
3. Error Handling
 Right now, if one record fails, the rest still process, but you’re catching
exceptions at the global level, so you may lose the specific record’s error reason.
 􈄥􍿁 Suggestion: Move try/catch inside the loop so each request has independent
failure handling.
4. Repository Update Method
 Your current query:
update NPARequest u set u.statusCode
=?2,u.requestSendDateTime=?3,u.shedulerMsg=?4 where u.reqId=?1
 Since nativeQuery = false, this is JPQL, so u must be an entity alias (which you
did correctly).
 Ensure requestSendDateTime is the same type as the entity field (if it’s a
LocalDateTime, pass that, not String).
􈄥􍿁 Example:
@Modifying
@Query("UPDATE NPARequest u SET u.statusCode = :statusCode,
u.requestSendDateTime = :dateTime, u.shedulerMsg = :message WHERE u.reqId =
:reqId")
void updateNPARequestStatusCode(@Param("reqId") String reqId,
@Param("statusCode") String statusCode,
@Param("dateTime") LocalDateTime localDatetime,
@Param("message") String message);
If you want, I can rewrite your service method so that:
 It processes requests in parallel threads for speed
 Has better transactional handling
 Handles partial failures cleanly
That way, if one NPA request fails, it won’t block or a􀆯ect others.
Do you want me to rewrite it that way?

localDatetime, String message); can you please explain me in detail the flow of the data
, and the working and what all is happening in this controller -service -rep
ChatGPT said:
Alright — let’s walk through exactly what’s happening in your controller → service →
repository flow, step by step, like tracing water through pipes. 􊲛
1. The Big Picture
Your /sendNpaRequest endpoint is:
1. Finding pending NPA requests in the DB
2. For each request:
o Marking it as "processed"
o Building a request payload from related data
o Encrypting it
o Sending it to an external NPA API
o Storing the API’s response
o Marking the record as "success"
3. If something fails, marking the record as "failed"
2. Controller Layer
@GetMapping(path = "/sendNpaRequest", produces =
MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public ResponseEntity<APIResponse> sendNPARequest() {
return nPAService.sendNPAdataRequest();
}
 Purpose: Exposes the /sendNpaRequest endpoint to the outside world.
 What it does: Calls the service method sendNPAdataRequest() and directly
returns whatever APIResponse it gets.
 Data so far: No input parameters, no data from the request body; all the work is
internal.
3. Service Layer — sendNPAdataRequest()
Here’s the detailed breakdown:
Step 1 — Fetch pending requests
List<NPARequest> listOfNPARequest = nPARequestRepository
.findByStatusCode(AppConstants.SHEDULER_REQUEST_STATUSCODE);
 Purpose: Pull all NPA requests that are in "pending/scheduled" state.
 Data: List of NPARequest entities from DB.
Step 2 — Loop through each request
for (NPARequest npaRequest : listOfNPARequest) {
reqId = npaRequest.getReqId();
 Purpose: Process one request at a time.
 Data: Working on a single NPARequest.
Step 3 — Mark as "processed"
nPARequestRepository.updateNPARequestStatusCode(
reqId, SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_PROCESSED.getStatusCode(),
CommonUtils.getCurrentDateAndTime(),
SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_PROCESSED.getStatusMsg());
 Purpose: Updates DB to indicate this request is now being processed.
 Data Flow:
o reqId identifies the row.
o statusCode changes to "processed".
o requestSendDateTime updated with current date/time.
o shedulerMsg updated with a status message.
Step 4 — Build and send API request
callNPARequest(npaRequest, npaRequestUrl, passphrase);
 This is the heavy-lifting method — let’s zoom in here in section 4.
Step 5 — Mark as "success"
nPARequestRepository.updateNPARequestStatusCode(
reqId, SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_SUCCESS.getStatusCode(),
CommonUtils.getCurrentDateAndTime(),
SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_SUCCESS.getStatusMsg());
 Purpose: Marks the record as successfully sent after the external call.
Step 6 — Handle exceptions
If any exception happens anywhere above:
nPARequestRepository.updateNPARequestStatusCode(
reqId, SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_FAILED.getStatusCode(),
CommonUtils.getCurrentDateAndTime(),
SidbiStatus.SHEDULER_FAILED.getStatusMsg());
 Marks record as failed and stores an error status message.
4. Inside callNPARequest() — The Data Journey
Now let’s see what happens when we send the request.
Step 4.1 — Fetch related request data
List<NPARequestData> listOfNPARequest =
nPARequestDataRepository.findByReqId(reqId);
 Pulls all NPARequestData child records linked to this reqId.
Step 4.2 — Convert to DTOs
for (NPARequestData npaRequestData : listOfNPARequest) {
NPARequestDataDto dto = getNPARequestDataDto(npaRequestData);
listOfNPARequestDataDto.add(dto);
}
 Transforms entity data into DTO format expected by the external API.
Step 4.3 — Build the request payload
RequestDto request = RequestDto.builder().data(listOfNPARequestDataDto).build();
String rawdata = MultipleJSONObjectHelper.getStringfromObject(request);
 Wraps all DTOs inside a single RequestDto.
 Serializes it into a JSON string (rawdata).
Step 4.4 — Save raw request in DB
nPARequestRepository.updateRequestInNPARequest(reqId, rawdata);
 Updates DB to store the exact raw request sent (for logging/audit).
Step 4.5 — Encrypt the payload
String encryptMessage = cGTMSCEncryption.encryptMessage(rawdata, passphrase);
 Encrypts the JSON string before sending to the external API.
Step 4.6 — Build API request wrapper
APIRequestDto requestDto = APIRequestDto.builder().data(encryptMessage).build();
 External API expects {"data":"<encrypted string>"} format.
Step 4.7 — Determine API URL
if(cgs_gms_status.equals("0")) {
npaRequestURL =
cGTMSCConfigurationsRepository.findByKey(AppConstants.OLD_CGTMSC_NPA_URL);
}
 Switches between new/old API endpoint based on config.
Step 4.8 — Call external API
String response = restAPIService.callRestAPI(
npaRequestURL,
tokenGeneration.getTokenForNPA(cgs_gms_status),
requestDto,
passphrase);
 Sends encrypted payload to API using generated token.
Step 4.9 — Store API response in DB
nPARequestRepository.updateResponseInNPARequest(reqId, response);
 Saves raw API response string for audit/debugging.
Step 4.10 — Parse response and store results
NPAResponseDto nPAResponseDto = MultipleJSONObjectHelper
.getObjectFromString(response, NPAResponseDto.class);
List<CursorDto> listOfCursors = nPAResponseDto.getCursor();
for (CursorDto cursor : listOfCursors) {
listofNPAResponses.add(NPAResponse.builder()
.cgpan(cursor.getCgpan())
.reqId(reqId)
.failPassStatus(cursor.getFailPassStatus())
.errorDetail(cursor.getErrorDetail())
.build());
}
nPAResponseRepository.saveAll(listofNPAResponses);
 Converts the raw API JSON response into a Java object.
 Extracts cursor elements and maps them to NPAResponse entities.
 Saves all responses in DB for reporting or later processing.
5. Repository Layer
Example:
@Modifying
@Query("update NPARequest u set u.statusCode =?2, u.requestSendDateTime =?3,
u.shedulerMsg =?4 where u.reqId =?1")
void updateNPARequestStatusCode(String reqId, String statusCode, String
localDatetime, String message);
 Executes JPQL to update only specific fields in DB without fetching the full
entity.
 This is faster than fetching + saving, but you must ensure type matching
(LocalDateTime vs String).
6. Data Flow Summary
Controller → Service → Repo → DB
↓
Builds Request Data → Encrypts → Sends API → Gets Response
↓
Updates DB
 DB Tables Involved:
o NPARequest → Master request
o NPARequestData → Line items/details for request
o NPAResponse → Parsed results from API response
If you want, I can now draw you a full data flow diagram with arrows showing DB
reads/writes, encryption, API calls, and status changes — that will make it much easier
to visualize.
Do you want me to prepare that?
You said:
HEY iwas asked a question to implement lru cache to return the last used index, or
some thing like this
ChatGPT said:
It sounds like the interviewer asked you to implement an LRU (Least Recently Used)
cache but also return the last used index (or recently accessed element) in addition
to standard caching functionality.
Let’s break this down and clarify what they might have meant, then I’ll show you how to
implement it.
Understanding the Question
An LRU cache usually:
 Stores key-value pairs.
 Removes the least recently used entry when capacity is full.
 On access (get/put), updates the usage order.
Now, “return the last used index” could mean:
1. Return the most recently accessed element’s index in the cache order.
Example: If you just accessed key 7, you might return something like “index 0”
meaning it’s now at the top of usage order.
2. Return the last recently used element (the one that will be evicted next).
Example: If the LRU element is key 3, you return that before eviction.
From interview patterns, it’s usually option 2 — returning the element that’s least
recently used before it gets replaced.
Approach
We can implement this in Java using:
 LinkedHashMap (ordered by access order).
 Or a custom Doubly Linked List + HashMap (for O(1) operations).
I’ll show the LinkedHashMap way (short & clean):
Code Example
import java.util.*;
class LRUCache<K, V> {
private final int capacity;
private final LinkedHashMap<K, V> cache;
public LRUCache(int capacity) {
this.capacity = capacity;
this.cache = new LinkedHashMap<>(capacity, 0.75f, true); // access-order
}
public V get(K key) {
return cache.getOrDefault(key, null);
}
public void put(K key, V value) {
if (cache.size() >= capacity && !cache.containsKey(key)) {
K lruKey = getLRUKey();
System.out.println("Least Recently Used Key (to be evicted): " + lruKey);
cache.remove(lruKey);
}
cache.put(key, value);
}
public K getLRUKey() {
// First inserted in access-order = least recently used
return cache.keySet().iterator().next();
}
public void printCache() {
System.out.println(cache);
}
}
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
LRUCache<Integer, String> lru = new LRUCache<>(3);
lru.put(1, "A");
lru.put(2, "B");
lru.put(3, "C");
lru.printCache();
lru.get(1); // Now 1 is most recently used
lru.put(4, "D"); // Evicts 2
lru.printCache();
System.out.println("Current LRU Key: " + lru.getLRUKey());
}
}
How it Works
 LinkedHashMap with accessOrder = true keeps items ordered by recent use.
 getLRUKey() fetches the first key in the map, which is the least recently used.
 Before inserting a new item, if capacity is reached, we remove the LRU key and
optionally print/return it.
􈄥􍿁 Time Complexity
 get() → O(1)
 put() → O(1)
 getLRUKey() → O(1)
If you want, I can also give you the custom doubly-linked-list + HashMap version,
which is the one interviewers usually prefer for “implement LRU from scratch” type
questions.
Do you want me to prepare that version too so you’re ready for follow-ups?
You said:
he also asked me what will you do to separate the logic from the main code
ChatGPT said:
Ah, that’s a classic “clean code” and “separation of concerns” interview follow-up.
When they ask “What will you do to separate the logic from the main code?” in this
context, they’re checking if you know how to avoid dumping business logic inside your
main method or mixing concerns.
What They Expect
1. Main method (or controller) → should only:
o Read inputs
o Call the service/cache class methods
o Print outputs
o Not contain algorithmic logic itself
2. Logic (e.g., LRU implementation) → should be in:
o A separate class (like LRUCache)
o Possibly even separate packages (service, util, cache, etc.)
o This makes it reusable, testable, and maintainable
3. Testing → Since logic is in a separate class, you can unit-test it without
depending on main.
How to Structure It
Instead of:
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// cache logic here (bad practice)
LinkedHashMap<Integer, String> cache = new LinkedHashMap<>();
// ...
}
}
We’d do:
LRUCache.java (logic class)
public class LRUCache<K, V> {
// All LRU logic here
}
Main.java (runner class)
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
LRUCache<Integer, String> cache = new LRUCache<>(3);
cache.put(1, "A");
cache.put(2, "B");
cache.get(1);
cache.put(3, "C");
System.out.println("LRU Key: " + cache.getLRUKey());
}
}
Why This Is Good
 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) — each class has one job
 Easy to unit test (LRUCacheTest without touching main)
 If you change LRU logic, you don’t touch main
 If you later use Spring Boot or a microservice, the cache logic is already
reusable in a service bean
If you want, I can take the LinkedHashMap LRU example I gave you earlier and refactor
it into a separate clean service class, so it’s exactly “logic separated from main code”
the way interviewers expect.
Do you want me to prepare that clean, interview-ready refactor?
You said:
if class A extends class b and class b has public, protected, private fields and methods
also , so what all will be accessed and what all can be not accessed inside the child
class
ChatGPT said:
Alright — let’s break it down clearly.
If class A extends class B, then inside A (the child class) you have access to some but
not all members of B (the parent class).
Accessibility in Child Class
Modifier
Accessible inside A (child
class in same package)
Accessible inside A (child class
in di􀆯erent package)
public 􈄥􍿁 Yes 􈄥􍿁 Yes
protected 􈄥􍿁 Yes
􈄥􍿁 Yes (because it’s a subclass —
even in a di􀆯erent package)
default
(package-private)
􈄥􍿁 Yes (only if same package) 􎆡 No (if di􀆯erent package)
private
􎆡 No (never, except via
getters/setters)
􎆡 No
Example
class B {
public int pub = 1;
protected int pro = 2;
int def = 3; // default
private int pri = 4;
public void pubMethod() {}
protected void proMethod() {}
void defMethod() {}
private void priMethod() {}
}
class A extends B {
void testAccess() {
System.out.println(pub); // 􈄥􍿁 allowed
System.out.println(pro); // 􈄥􍿁 allowed
System.out.println(def); // 􈄥􍿁 allowed only if same package
// System.out.println(pri); // 􎆡 not allowed (private)
pubMethod(); // 􈄥􍿁
proMethod(); // 􈄥􍿁
defMethod(); // 􈄥􍿁 only if same package
// priMethod(); // 􎆡
}
}
􈄥􍿁 Key Rules to Remember in Interviews
1. Private members are never directly accessible in the child — not even in the
same package.
2. Protected gives access in:
o Same package: works like default
o Di􀆯erent package: only works in subclasses, not in unrelated classes
3. Default (package-private) → accessible only if both classes are in the same
package.
4. Public → accessible everywhere.
If you want, I can also give you a diagram showing this inheritance accessibility so you
can answer it in 5 seconds in an interview. That’s what usually impresses interviewers.
You said:
explain concept of immutability alongwith its implementation in a class
ChatGPT said:
Alright — let’s go step-by-step so you can explain immutability in an interview and
implement it without missing anything.
1. Concept of Immutability
Immutability means:
Once an object is created, its state (data) cannot be changed.
 All fields are set only once — at construction time.
 No setter methods or direct modification of fields.
 Even if a field is mutable (e.g., a List or Date), you ensure no one can change it
after creation by using defensive copies.
Example in real life:
String in Java — once you create it, you cannot change its characters.
2. Why Immutability is Important
 Thread safety — immutable objects can be safely shared between threads
without synchronization.
 Safe caching — no risk of an object being changed after you store it in a cache.
 Easy debugging — state never changes unexpectedly.
3. Rules to Make a Class Immutable
1. Declare the class as final so it cannot be extended.
2. Make all fields private and final.
3. Do not provide any setter methods.
4. Initialize all fields via constructor.
5. If a field is mutable, return a copy in getters (defensive copy) instead of the
original reference.
6. If a constructor gets a mutable object as a parameter, store a copy instead of the
reference.
4. Implementation Example
import java.util.Date;
public final class Employee {
private final String name;
private final int id;
private final Date joiningDate; // mutable field
public Employee(String name, int id, Date joiningDate) {
this.name = name;
this.id = id;
// Defensive copy to prevent external modification
this.joiningDate = new Date(joiningDate.getTime());
}
public String getName() {
return name;
}
public int getId() {
return id;
}
public Date getJoiningDate() {
// Return a copy, not the original object
return new Date(joiningDate.getTime());
}
}
5. How It Works
Date date = new Date();
Employee emp = new Employee("John", 101, date);
// Trying to modify after creation
date.setTime(System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000000);
// Still original date inside Employee — because of defensive copy
System.out.println(emp.getJoiningDate());
 The internal state never changes, even if someone tries to mutate the passed
object or the object returned by a getter.
If you want, I can also give you a quick interview-style answer for immutability so you
can explain it in under 40 seconds and then write this code confidently. That way, you
cover both theory + practical perfectly.
You said:
show singleton design pattern
ChatGPT said:
Alright — let’s go over the Singleton Design Pattern step-by-step and then I’ll show you
the clean code for it.
1. Concept
Singleton Pattern ensures:
 Only one instance of a class exists in the entire application.
 That single instance is globally accessible.
Real-world analogy:
A printer spooler — you don’t want multiple spooling managers conflicting with each
other.
2. Common Uses
 Logging service
 Configuration manager
 Thread pool manager
 Caching system
3. Rules for Singleton
1. Private constructor → prevents creating objects from outside.
2. A static reference to hold the single instance.
3. A public static method to return that instance.
4. Implementation Types
A) Eager Initialization (thread-safe, simple)
public class EagerSingleton {
private static final EagerSingleton INSTANCE = new EagerSingleton();
private EagerSingleton() {} // private constructor
public static EagerSingleton getInstance() {
return INSTANCE;
}
}
Pros: Simple, thread-safe.
Cons: Instance is created even if never used.
B) Lazy Initialization with Synchronization (thread-safe but slower)
public class LazySingleton {
private static LazySingleton instance;
private LazySingleton() {}
public static synchronized LazySingleton getInstance() {
if (instance == null) {
instance = new LazySingleton();
}
return instance;
}
}
Pros: Created only when needed.
Cons: synchronized makes it slower.
C) Double-Checked Locking (fast & thread-safe)
public class DoubleCheckedSingleton {
private static volatile DoubleCheckedSingleton instance;
private DoubleCheckedSingleton() {}
public static DoubleCheckedSingleton getInstance() {
if (instance == null) {
synchronized (DoubleCheckedSingleton.class) {
if (instance == null) {
instance = new DoubleCheckedSingleton();
}
}
}
return instance;
}
}
Pros: Thread-safe, faster than method-level locking.
Cons: Slightly more complex.
D) Bill Pugh Singleton (best practice in modern Java)
public class BillPughSingleton {
private BillPughSingleton() {}
private static class SingletonHelper {
private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton();
}
public static BillPughSingleton getInstance() {
return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
}
}
Pros:
 Thread-safe
 Lazy-loaded
 No synchronization overhead
If you want, I can also combine this with immutability and show you an Immutable
Singleton class — that’s something interviewers love asking. Would you like me to show
that?
You said:
explain abstraction also with a class
ChatGPT said:
Alright — let’s go through Abstraction in Java with a real example.
1. Concept
Abstraction means showing only the necessary details to the outside world and
hiding the internal implementation.
It focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.
Key Points
 Achieved in Java via:
1. Abstract classes
2. Interfaces
 You cannot instantiate an abstract class directly.
 Abstract classes can have both:
o Abstract methods (no body)
o Concrete methods (with body)
2. Example with Abstract Class
Let’s say we have di􀆯erent payment methods, but we don’t want the client code to
worry about the internal implementation.
// Abstract Class
abstract class Payment {
// Abstract method — must be implemented by subclasses
abstract void processPayment(double amount);
// Concrete method — can be used as is or overridden
public void paymentStatus() {
System.out.println("Payment status: Processing...");
}
}
// Subclass 1
class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
@Override
void processPayment(double amount) {
System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of ₹" + amount);
}
}
// Subclass 2
class UpiPayment extends Payment {
@Override
void processPayment(double amount) {
System.out.println("Processing UPI payment of ₹" + amount);
}
}
// Main class
public class AbstractionExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Payment payment1 = new CreditCardPayment();
payment1.processPayment(5000);
payment1.paymentStatus();
Payment payment2 = new UpiPayment();
payment2.processPayment(2500);
payment2.paymentStatus();
}
}
3. How this shows Abstraction
 The Payment class defines what should be done (processPayment) but not how
— that’s left for subclasses.
 The client code (main method) doesn’t care about the exact payment
processing logic — it just calls the method.
If you want, I can also give you a real-world Microservices-based abstraction
example so it’s more interview-ready.
Do you want me to prepare that?
You said:
some queries run on column a only, some queries run on column b and c, some querier
run on column a,b,c together. so what minimum indexes do we need
ChatGPT said:
For your case, the minimum indexes you need while still covering all query patterns
e􀆯iciently would be:
Query patterns given
1. Queries on column a only → Need an index on a
2. Queries on columns b and c together → Need a composite index on (b, c)
3. Queries on columns a, b, c together → Could use a composite index on (a, b, c)
But… we can minimize indexes
We can take advantage of the leftmost prefix rule for composite indexes.
If we create:
1. Index on a — covers queries only on a
2. Index on (b, c) — covers queries on b and c
3. Index on (a, b, c) — covers queries on all three together
That’s 3 indexes.
Can we reduce further?
 The (a, b, c) index also covers queries on a alone (because of leftmost prefix), but
it will not e􀆯iciently cover (b, c) because b is not the leftmost column in that
index.
 So we cannot remove (b, c) index if (b, c) queries are frequent.
􈄥􍿁 Minimum indexes needed:
(a, b, c) -- covers (a), (a, b), (a, b, c)
(b, c) -- covers (b, c)
That’s just 2 indexes instead of 3.
If you want, I can also explain how the leftmost prefix rule works with a small table
example so it’s crystal clear.
Do you want me to do that?

lru implementation using linked hashmap
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a simple LRU Cache implementation using LinkedHashMap in Java:
Code
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.Map;
public class LRUCache<K, V> extends LinkedHashMap<K, V> {
private final int capacity;
public LRUCache(int capacity) {
// true = access order (most recent last), false = insertion order
super(capacity, 0.75f, true);
this.capacity = capacity;
}
@Override
protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<K, V> eldest) {
// Remove the oldest entry if size exceeds capacity
return size() > capacity;
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
LRUCache<Integer, String> cache = new LRUCache<>(3);
cache.put(1, "A");
cache.put(2, "B");
cache.put(3, "C");
System.out.println(cache); // {1=A, 2=B, 3=C}
// Access 1 → moves it to most recently used
cache.get(1);
cache.put(4, "D"); // Removes least recently used (2)
System.out.println(cache); // {3=C, 1=A, 4=D}
}
}
Key Points
1. LinkedHashMap with accessOrder = true
Maintains the order of elements based on access, so least recently used is at the
start.
2. Override removeEldestEntry
Automatically removes the oldest entry once the size exceeds the given capacity.
3. O(1) Time Complexity
All put and get operations are constant time.
If you want, I can also add a method to return the last accessed index (which your
interviewer hinted at) without breaking the LRU order.
Do you want me to modify this code for that?
You said:
i was asked to make this lru implementation code extendible
ChatGPT said:
Got it — the interviewer likely wanted you to make the LRU cache logic reusable and
extensible so that it’s not locked to one hard-coded use case.
Here’s how we can make the code extensible:
Key Improvements for Extensibility
1. Use an interface so the LRUCache can be swapped with another cache type
without changing business logic.
2. Use generics so it works for any key/value type.
3. Make eviction policy pluggable (strategy pattern) if needed in future.
4. Avoid hard-coding capacity in the class — pass it in from outside.
5. Separate “cache logic” from “main code” — no main() inside the cache class.
Extensible LRU Cache
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.Map;
// Step 1: Create a Cache interface for extensibility
interface Cache<K, V> {
void put(K key, V value);
V get(K key);
int size();
}
// Step 2: Make LRUCache generic and extend LinkedHashMap
public class LRUCache<K, V> extends LinkedHashMap<K, V> implements Cache<K, V>
{
private final int capacity;
public LRUCache(int capacity) {
super(capacity, 0.75f, true); // accessOrder = true
this.capacity = capacity;
}
@Override
public void put(K key, V value) {
super.put(key, value);
}
@Override
public V get(Object key) {
return super.get(key);
}
@Override
public int size() {
return super.size();
}
@Override
protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<K, V> eldest) {
return size() > capacity;
}
}
Usage in Business Code (Separate from Cache Logic)
public class LRUCacheDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Cache<Integer, String> cache = new LRUCache<>(3); // can be swapped with
another cache
cache.put(1, "A");
cache.put(2, "B");
cache.put(3, "C");
System.out.println(cache); // {1=A, 2=B, 3=C}
cache.get(1); // Accessing moves it to most recent
cache.put(4, "D"); // Removes 2 (least recently used)
System.out.println(cache); // {3=C, 1=A, 4=D}
}
}
Benefits of This Design
 Reusability — can be used anywhere without rewriting cache logic.
 Replaceability — swap LRU with other strategies without changing core code.
 Testability — easy to mock Cache<K, V> in unit tests.
 Scalability — eviction logic can be overridden in subclasses.
If you want, I can extend this design to also keep track of the last accessed index/key
so it matches exactly what your interviewer asked.
Do you want me to do that next?

how many types of application context are there , explain
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􈸀􈸁 — this is a Spring Core interview favorite.
In Spring Framework, ApplicationContext is the central interface for providing
configuration information to the application.
Spring provides multiple implementations of ApplicationContext, depending on how
you load bean definitions and the environment.
Types of ApplicationContext in Spring
1. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
 Loads context definition from an XML file located in the classpath.
 Commonly used in early Spring projects.
ApplicationContext context =
new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Use case: When your beans.xml is bundled inside your JAR/WAR and available on
the classpath.
2. FileSystemXmlApplicationContext
 Loads context definition from an XML file using an absolute or relative path
from the file system.
ApplicationContext context =
new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext("C:/spring/beans.xml");
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Use case: When configuration file is outside the classpath (externalized).
3. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
 Loads Spring context using Java-based configuration (@Configuration
classes) instead of XML.
ApplicationContext context =
new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Use case: Modern Spring Boot / Java config based projects (no XML).
4. WebApplicationContext
 Specialized ApplicationContext for web applications.
 Used inside Spring MVC and Spring Boot Web projects.
 Automatically created by Spring’s DispatcherServlet.
@WebListener
public class MyWebAppInitializer implements ServletContextListener {
@Override
public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent event) {
WebApplicationContext context =
new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();
((AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext) context).register(WebConfig.class);
}
}
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Use case: For servlet-based web apps, to manage web components (controllers,
services, views).
5. GenericApplicationContext
 A flexible context that can be configured programmatically.
 Can register beans via code, XML, or annotations.
GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
context.registerBean(MyService.class);
context.refresh();
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Use case: When you want full programmatic control of context (e.g., dynamic
bean registration).

Would you like me to also show what’s the di􀆯erence between BeanFactory and
ApplicationContext? (interviewers usually follow up with that).
You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈸀􈸁 This is indeed the classic follow-up question after ApplicationContext
types.
Let’s break it down:
BeanFactory vs ApplicationContext
Both are IoC (Inversion of Control) containers in Spring, used for managing beans
(creating, configuring, wiring, and managing lifecycle).
But they have di􀆯erences in features and usage.
1. BeanFactory
 The basic container.
 Defined by org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory.
 Provides only the fundamental DI (Dependency Injection) functionalities.
 Lazy initialization → beans are created only when requested (getBean()).
Example:
BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(
new FileSystemResource("beans.xml"));
MyService service = factory.getBean("myService", MyService.class);
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Use Case: Very lightweight apps (rare in real projects, mostly historical).
2. ApplicationContext
 The advanced container built on top of BeanFactory.
 Defined by org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext.
 Provides all features of BeanFactory + extra enterprise features.
 Eager initialization → creates beans at startup by default (can be lazy if
annotated).
Example:
ApplicationContext context =
new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
MyService service = context.getBean("myService", MyService.class);
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Use Case: Almost all modern Spring apps (including Spring Boot).
Key Di􀆯erences
Feature BeanFactory ApplicationContext
Initialization
Lazy (creates
bean when
needed)
Eager (creates all singleton
beans at startup by default)
Enterprise Features Not available
Supports internationalization,
event publishing, AOP,
annotation scanning
BeanPostProcessor &
BeanFactoryPostProcessor
Must register
manually
Automatically detects and
registers
Resource Handling Limited
Supports resource loading (e.g.,
from classpath, filesystem, URL)
Event Handling Not supported
Built-in event mechanism
(publish/subscribe)
Annotation Support Limited
Full annotation support
(@Autowired, @Component,
@Configuration, etc.)
Usage
Lightweight,
simple apps
Almost always used in real-world
apps
􈄥􍿁 Summary
 BeanFactory = low-level, minimalistic, lazy.
 ApplicationContext = full-fledged container with enterprise features.
 Spring Boot always uses ApplicationContext (usually
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext or WebApplicationContext).
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 In interviews, the safe answer is:
“BeanFactory provides basic DI and is lazy by default, while ApplicationContext builds
on it and adds enterprise features like event publishing, AOP, internationalization,
annotation scanning, and eager loading. In real-world apps we mostly use
ApplicationContext.”
Would you like me to also explain how ApplicationContext relates to BeanFactory
(since it actually extends BeanFactory)? This is another common trap interviewers set.

di􀆯erence b/w array and linkedlist
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􋜜􋜝􋜡􋜢􋜞􋜟􋜠 — this one is a classic data structures interview question. Let’s
break it down clearly:
Array vs LinkedList
Feature Array LinkedList
Storage
Stored in contiguous
memory
Stored in non-contiguous memory, nodes
connected with references (pointers)
Structure
Collection of elements of
fixed size
Collection of nodes → each node = data +
reference (next/prev)
Size
Fixed (defined at
creation)
Dynamic (can grow/shrink at runtime)
Access Time
O(1) (direct access using
index → arr[i])
O(n) (must traverse nodes one by one)
Insertion /
Deletion
Costly → O(n) (shifting
required)
E􀆯icient → O(1) if pointer is known (just
relink nodes)
Memory Usage
Less memory (only
elements stored)
More memory (extra space for pointers)
Cache
Friendliness
High (contiguous, stored
in CPU cache easily)
Low (nodes scattered in memory, poor
locality of reference)
Feature Array LinkedList
Best For
Fast random access,
fixed-size data
Frequent insertions/deletions, dynamic size
Example in Java
Array
int[] arr = new int[5];
arr[0] = 10; // O(1) access
arr[1] = 20;
LinkedList
LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();
list.add(10);
list.add(20);
list.remove(0); // O(1) if head, O(n) if random index
Performance Comparison
Operation Array LinkedList
Access by Index O(1) O(n)
Search O(n) O(n)
Insert at End O(1) (if space available) O(1)
Insert/Delete at Middle O(n) (shift required) O(1) (if pointer known)
Memory Usage Less More (extra reference per node)
􈄥􍿁 Summary (interview-friendly answer):
Arrays are stored in contiguous memory and allow O(1) random access but resizing and
insert/delete are costly. LinkedList uses nodes with pointers, allows fast insert/delete
(O(1)) but random access is O(n) and uses extra memory.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Do you want me to also explain ArrayList vs LinkedList in Java (since many
interviewers mix this up with the data structure di􀆯erence)?
You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈸀􈸁 This is another favorite interview twist – they first ask Array vs LinkedList
(theory), then jump to ArrayList vs LinkedList (Java implementation). Let’s break it
down:
ArrayList vs LinkedList in Java
Feature ArrayList LinkedList
Underlying DS
Dynamic array (resizable
array)
Doubly Linked List
Access (get by index)
O(1) → Direct access using
index
O(n) → Must traverse from
head/tail
Insertion at End
Amortized O(1) (sometimes
resizing happens)
O(1)
Insertion/Deletion at
Middle
O(n) (shifting elements)
O(1) if node reference known,
otherwise O(n)
Search by Value O(n) O(n)
Memory Usage Less (only array of objects)
More (each node stores data + 2
references: prev & next)
Iteration
Faster (cache friendly,
contiguous memory)
Slower (scattered memory
locations)
When to Use
Best for random access and
read-heavy operations
Best for insert/delete-heavy
operations
Example Code in Java
import java.util.*;
public class ArrayVsLinked {
public static void main(String[] args) {
List<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
List<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();
// Adding elements
arrayList.add(10);
arrayList.add(20);
linkedList.add(10);
linkedList.add(20);
// Accessing elements
System.out.println("ArrayList get(1): " + arrayList.get(1)); // O(1)
System.out.println("LinkedList get(1): " + linkedList.get(1)); // O(n)
// Removing elements
arrayList.remove(0); // O(n) (shift required)
linkedList.remove(0); // O(1) (re-link nodes)
}
}
Quick Interview Summary
 ArrayList → backed by dynamic array → best for random access & read-heavy
workloads.
 LinkedList → backed by doubly linked list → best for frequent
insertions/deletions.
 Trade-o􀆯: ArrayList is cache friendly, LinkedList uses more memory.
􎁒 Interviewer’s follow-up trick:
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 If asked "Which is faster, ArrayList or LinkedList?" → In practice, ArrayList is faster
in most cases because CPU caching + less memory overhead outweigh LinkedList’s
theoretical O(1) insert/delete.
Do you want me to also show you a real-world scenario question like:
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 "If you had 1M records and needed frequent searches vs frequent insertions, which
one would you pick?"

di􀆯erence b/w big o , big o omega and big o theta
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􊻠􊻡 — interviewers love to test this to see if you really understand time
complexity notation beyond just Big-O.
Let’s break it down with simple terms and examples 􈷂􈷄􈷅􈷆􈷃
1. Big-O (Upper Bound / Worst Case)
 Describes the maximum time an algorithm can take.
 Think of it as a guarantee that it won’t be worse than this.
 Used most often in interviews (because we usually care about worst case).
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 Linear search in an array of size n:
o Worst case = element not found → check all n elements.
o Time complexity = O(n)
2. Big-Ω (Omega) (Lower Bound / Best Case)
 Describes the minimum time an algorithm will take.
 Think of it as the best case guarantee.
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 Linear search:
o Best case = element found at index 0 → only 1 comparison.
o Time complexity = Ω(1)
3. Big-Θ (Theta) (Tight Bound / Average Case)
 Describes when an algorithm’s upper and lower bounds are the same order.
 It means the algorithm will always take about this much time.
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 Linear search:
o On average, element found in middle → ~n/2 comparisons.
o Time complexity = Θ(n)
Summary Table
Notation Meaning Example (Linear Search in n elements)
O(f(n)) Upper bound (worst case) O(n) → might need to check all n
Ω(f(n)) Lower bound (best case) Ω(1) → might find at first element
Θ(f(n)) Tight bound (average case) Θ(n) → ~half elements checked
Analogy (Real-Life Example 􈙌􈙇􈙈􈙉􈙊􈙋)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Suppose you commute to o􀆯ice daily:
 Big-O (worst case): "The commute takes at most 2 hours (tra􀆯ic jam)."
 Big-Ω (best case): "The commute takes at least 30 minutes (no tra􀆯ic)."
 Big-Θ (average case): "Usually, it takes about 1 hour."
􎁒 Interview Tip: If they ask “What’s the di􀆯erence?”
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer:
 O → Upper bound (worst case).
 Ω → Lower bound (best case).
 Θ → Tight bound (average/typical case, when O and Ω match).
Would you like me to also give you a code example (like searching or sorting) showing
all three notations applied? That way you’ll have a ready-to-use explanation for
interviews.

HOW will you find the missing number in a list of continuous number
ChatGPT said:
Nice one 􋜜􋜝􋜡􋜢􋜞􋜟􋜠 — This is one of the classic interview questions.
You’re given a list/array of continuous numbers (say 1 to n), but one number is
missing. You need to find it e􀆯iciently.
􈄥􍿁 Approaches:
1. Sum Formula (Most common & e􀆯icient)
 The sum of first n natural numbers is:
Sum=n(n+1)2\text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}Sum=2n(n+1)
 Compute the expected sum, subtract the actual sum of the array → missing
number.
 Time Complexity: O(n)
 Space Complexity: O(1)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Example:
public class MissingNumber {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}; // Missing 4
int n = arr.length + 1; // since one number is missing
int expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
int actualSum = 0;
for (int num : arr) {
actualSum += num;
}
int missing = expectedSum - actualSum;
System.out.println("Missing Number: " + missing); // Output: 4
}
}
2. XOR Method (Bit Manipulation)
 XOR of 1..n and XOR of all elements in array.
 Since a ^ a = 0, everything cancels out → only missing number remains.
 Works well because it avoids integer overflow (better than sum method in huge
ranges).
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Example:
public class MissingNumberXOR {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}; // Missing 4
int n = arr.length + 1;
int xor1 = 0, xor2 = 0;
// XOR of 1..n
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
xor1 ^= i;
}
// XOR of array elements
for (int num : arr) {
xor2 ^= num;
}
int missing = xor1 ^ xor2;
System.out.println("Missing Number: " + missing); // Output: 4
}
}
3. Sorting / HashSet Approach (Less e􀆯icient)
 Sort the array and check which number is missing. (O(n log n))
 Or insert into a HashSet and check which number is absent. (O(n), but extra
space O(n)).
􊺜 Key Takeaway for Interviews:
 Best answers: Sum Formula (simple) or XOR Method (handles overflow).
 If interviewer insists on huge numbers where n*(n+1)/2 might overflow → use
XOR.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Do you want me to also show you how to find multiple missing numbers (not just
one) from the list?

how does java handles memory management
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􈷼􈷽􈷾􈷿 — Java’s memory management is one of its strongest features,
because it abstracts away manual allocation and deallocation (like in C/C++).
Let’s break it down:
􊼡 1. Memory Areas in JVM
When a Java program runs, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) divides memory into
di􀆯erent areas:
1. Heap
o Stores objects and their instance variables.
o Managed by Garbage Collector (GC).
o Divided into:
 Young Generation (Eden + Survivor spaces): newly created
objects.
 Old/Tenured Generation: long-lived objects.
 Metaspace (Java 8+): stores class metadata.
2. Stack
o Stores method call frames (local variables, references, return
addresses).
o Each thread has its own stack.
o Memory is automatically freed when a method ends.
3. Method Area
o Stores class structure (bytecode, method info, static variables).
o Part of Metaspace since Java 8.
4. PC Register
o Each thread has a Program Counter (PC) register that stores the current
executing instruction address.
5. Native Method Stack
o For native (non-Java) method calls (e.g., C/C++ libraries).
􊼡 2. Object Creation & Memory Allocation
 When you do:
 Employee emp = new Employee();
o The reference emp is stored in the stack.
o The actual object (fields, data) is stored in the heap.
􊼡 3. Garbage Collection (GC)
 Java automatically frees memory of objects that are no longer referenced.
 GC algorithms (depending on JVM implementation, e.g., HotSpot):
o Mark & Sweep: marks live objects, removes unused ones.
o Generational GC: optimizes by separating short-lived and long-lived
objects.
o G1 GC, ZGC, Shenandoah: modern low-latency collectors.
􊼡 4. Memory Leaks in Java?
Even though Java has GC, memory leaks can still happen if references are
unintentionally held:
 Static collections holding objects forever.
 Not closing resources (DB connections, streams).
 Inner classes holding outer class references.
Use WeakReference / SoftReference and try-with-resources to avoid leaks.
􊼡 5. Tuning Memory in JVM
You can control heap and GC with JVM flags:
java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:+UseG1GC MyApp
 -Xms → initial heap size
 -Xmx → max heap size
 -XX:+UseG1GC → use G1 Garbage Collector
􈄥􍿁 Summary for interviews:
Java memory management is handled by JVM through:
 Automatic memory allocation (stack for local vars, heap for objects).
 Garbage Collection for unused objects.
 Generational heap structure for e􀆯iciency.
Would you like me to also show you a diagram (Heap + Stack + GC process) so you can
easily explain in interviews?
You said:
how does class loading works in jvm
ChatGPT said:
Nice one 􈸀􈸁 — Class Loading in JVM is a very popular interview question. Let’s break it
down step by step.
􊼡 JVM Class Loading Process
When you run a Java program, classes are not loaded all at once. Instead, the JVM uses
a lazy loading mechanism (loads classes when first needed).
The class loading process has 3 main phases + 1 optional step:
􈄥􈄩 Loading
 The ClassLoader loads the .class file (bytecode) into Method Area (Metaspace
in Java 8+).
 Each class has only one copy in Method Area.
 Types of class loaders (hierarchical):
1. Bootstrap ClassLoader
 Part of JVM (native code, not Java).
 Loads core Java classes (rt.jar, java.base in modules). Example:
java.lang.String.
2. Extension ClassLoader (Platform ClassLoader in Java 9+)
 Loads classes from jre/lib/ext or modules.
3. Application ClassLoader
 Loads user-defined classes from classpath.
 Uses parent delegation model → request goes from child → parent first.
􈄥􈄪 Linking
Once loaded, the class undergoes verification and preparation:
1. Verification
o Ensures bytecode follows JVM rules (no stack underflow/overflow, valid
instructions).
o Prevents malicious bytecode execution.
2. Preparation
o Allocates memory for static variables.
o Assigns default values (e.g., int = 0, boolean = false).
3. Resolution
o Replaces symbolic references (like "java/lang/String") with actual
references in memory.
􈄥􈄫 Initialization
 Executes static initializers (static {} blocks) and assigns explicit values to static
fields.
 Example:
 class Demo {
 static int x = 10;
 static {
 System.out.println("Class Demo Initialized");
 }
 }
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 When Demo is first referenced, JVM runs static block and assigns x=10.
􈄥􈄬 (Optional) Unloading
 JVM can unload classes, but only when the ClassLoader that loaded them is
garbage collected.
 Typically happens in application servers (Tomcat, WebLogic) when redeploying
apps.
􊼡 ClassLoader Hierarchy (Parent Delegation Model)
Bootstrap ClassLoader
↑
Platform/Extension ClassLoader
↑
Application ClassLoader
 If a class is requested:
o First parent is asked.
o If parent cannot find, child loads it.
 Prevents duplicate loading and ensures security (e.g., cannot override
java.lang.String).
􊼡 Example in Code
public class ClassLoaderDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(String.class.getClassLoader()); // null (Bootstrap)
System.out.println(ClassLoaderDemo.class.getClassLoader()); // AppClassLoader
}
}
Output:
null
jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$AppClassLoader@...
􈄥􍿁 Interview Summary
 Loading → Linking → Initialization → (Unloading).
 ClassLoaders follow parent delegation model.
 Classes are loaded lazily when first needed.
 Security & e􀆯iciency ensured by verification + single copy per JVM.
Do you want me to also give you a real-time scenario question (like: "How would you
troubleshoot ClassNotFoundException vs NoClassDefFoundError") — since this is also
very common in interviews?
You said:
what are di􀆯erent scopes of a bean
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􈸀􈸁 — Bean Scopes is one of the most asked Spring interview topics.
In Spring, a bean scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of a bean (i.e., how long it
lives and how many instances are created).
􊼡 Spring Bean Scopes
􈄥􈄩 Singleton (Default)
 One instance per Spring IoC container.
 Cached and shared for every request to that bean.
 Best for stateless beans (e.g., services, DAOs).
@Component
@Scope("singleton")
public class MyService {}
􈄥􈄪 Prototype
 New bean instance every time it is requested from the container.
 Best for stateful beans (holding request/session-specific data).
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class MyPrototype {}
􈄥􈄫 Request (Web-aware only)
 One bean instance per HTTP request.
 Valid only in Spring WebApplicationContext.
@Component
@Scope("request")
public class MyRequestBean {}
􈄥􈄬 Session (Web-aware only)
 One bean instance per HTTP session.
 Lives as long as the HTTP session is active.
@Component
@Scope("session")
public class MySessionBean {}
􈄮􈄭 Application (Web-aware only)
 One bean instance per ServletContext.
 Shared across all sessions and requests in that web application.
@Component
@Scope("application")
public class MyAppBean {}
􈄥􈄯 WebSocket (Web-aware only, Spring 4.2+)
 One bean per WebSocket session.
@Component
@Scope("websocket")
public class MyWebSocketBean {}
􊼡 Quick Comparison Table
Scope Instance per… Use Case
singleton IoC container Stateless beans (services, DAOs)
prototype Request for bean Stateful, short-lived beans
request HTTP request Request-scoped data (like DTOs)

􈄥􍿁 Interview Tip:
 Default is singleton.
 Web scopes (request, session, application, websocket) require Spring
WebApplicationContext.
 If asked about Thread-safety → Singleton beans are not thread-safe by default,
so avoid storing mutable state.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Do you want me to also explain how to make a singleton bean behave like
prototype inside it (using @Lookup or ObjectFactory)? This is another favorite interview
follow-up.

key principles of rest api
ChatGPT said:
Good one 􈸀􈸁 — REST API design principles are core interview questions.
Here are the Key Principles of REST APIs:
􊼡 1. Client–Server Architecture
 Separation of concerns:
o Client (frontend/UI) handles presentation.
o Server handles data storage & business logic.
 Benefits: scalability, flexibility, reusability.
􊼡 2. Statelessness
 Each request from client → server must contain all necessary information
(auth, data).
 Server does not store client state between requests.
 Benefits: reliability, horizontal scalability.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Example: JWT tokens used for authentication instead of session stored on server.
􊼡 3. Uniform Interface
 Consistent, predictable API design.
 Achieved via:
o Resource-based URIs (/users/1/orders/10).
o Standard HTTP methods:
 GET → Read
 POST → Create
 PUT/PATCH → Update
 DELETE → Delete
o Standard status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server
Error).
o Consistent representation (JSON, XML).
􊼡 4. Cacheability
 Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not.
 Helps reduce load and improves performance.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Example: Cache-Control headers in responses.
􊼡 5. Layered System
 Client doesn’t need to know if it’s connected to the direct server or an
intermediary (like load balancer, proxy, API gateway).
 Improves scalability and security.
􊼡 6. Code on Demand (Optional)
 Servers can return executable code (e.g., JavaScript).
 Rarely used in practice for REST APIs.
􊼡 7. Resource Identification via URIs
 Resources are identified using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
 Example:
o /users/123 → user with ID 123.
o /orders/567/items → items of order 567.
􊼡 8. Representation-Oriented
 Resources can have multiple representations (JSON, XML, HTML).
 Client and server use Content Negotiation (Accept / Content-Type headers).
􈄥􍿁 Summary for interview:
REST APIs follow 6 core principles:
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Client-Server, Stateless, Uniform Interface, Cacheable, Layered System, Codeon-
Demand (optional).
Would you like me to also prepare a quick “Do’s & Don’ts of REST API design” (like URI
naming conventions, versioning, error handling) for interview answers?
You said:
we have a rest api in production , and now the requirement changes and we need to do
some changes in the logic code, so how we can release changes without breaking
existing clients
ChatGPT said:
Great scenario 􋜜􋜝􋜡􋜢􋜞􋜟􋜠 — this is a real-time interview favorite.
If you already have a REST API in production and the requirement changes, you must
ensure that existing clients (consumers) don’t break when you deploy changes.
Here’s how you can safely release changes:
􊼡 1. Backward Compatibility
 Always ensure new changes are backward compatible unless you are
versioning.
 Examples of safe changes:
o Adding new optional fields in response.
o Adding new endpoints.
o Adding new query parameters (optional).
􎁏􎁐􎁑 Breaking changes (like removing fields, renaming, changing response structure)
should not be done directly.
􊼡 2. API Versioning
If backward compatibility isn’t possible → version the API.
 URI Versioning (common)
o /api/v1/users → old
o /api/v2/users → new logic
 Header Versioning
o Clients send Accept-Version: v2.
 Query Parameter Versioning
o /api/users?version=2.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Most companies go with URI versioning since it’s easy to manage.
􊼡 3. Feature Flags / Configurable Logic
 Hide new logic behind feature toggles.
 Old clients continue to use existing behavior.
 New clients can opt-in by sending a flag/parameter.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Example: /users?enableNewLogic=true
􊼡 4. Deprecation Strategy
 Announce deprecated APIs but keep them running for some time.
 Add deprecation headers in responses:
 Deprecation: true
 Sunset: Wed, 11 Nov 2026 23:59:59 GMT
 Give clients enough time to migrate.
􊼡 5. Blue-Green or Canary Deployment
 Release new changes gradually:
o Blue-Green Deployment → run both versions (old + new) and switch
tra􀆯ic gradually.
o Canary Deployment → send small % of tra􀆯ic to new version, monitor,
then roll out.
􊼡 6. Contract Testing
 Use Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (e.g., Pact) to ensure existing clients
won’t break when the API changes.
􈄥􍿁 Short interview answer you can give:
“In production, we never break existing clients. We make changes in a backwardcompatible
way, and if that’s not possible, we version the API (like /v2). We can also use
feature flags for gradual rollout, and adopt blue-green/canary deployment strategies.
Deprecated APIs are supported for a while until clients migrate.”
Would you like me to also prepare a list of examples of breaking vs non-breaking API
changes (so you can tell interviewers exactly what counts as safe and unsafe)?
You said:
yes please
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈸀􈸁 this is something interviewers really like — if you can clearly di􀆯erentiate
between breaking vs non-breaking changes.
􈄥􍿁 Non-Breaking (Backward-Compatible) API Changes
Safe to release without a􀆯ecting existing clients:
1. Adding new endpoints
o Old clients don’t know/call them, so no impact.
o Example: Add /orders/{id}/tracking.
2. Adding new optional request parameters
o Clients can ignore them.
o Example: /users?sortBy=name.
3. Adding new fields in the response
o JSON/XML parsers ignore unknown fields (if clients are coded properly).
o Example:
o { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@test.com" }
(old clients only use id and name).
4. Changing internal logic without changing contract
o Performance improvements, new DB, caching, etc.
o Example: /users returns same response but now faster.
5. Increasing rate limits / pagination defaults
o As long as existing queries still work.
􎆡 Breaking API Changes
These will cause clients to fail unless versioned:
1. Removing or renaming fields in the response
o Example: Response field email renamed to userEmail.
2. Changing response data type
o Example: Changing id: number → id: string.
3. Removing endpoints
o Example: Deleting /users/{id}/details.
4. Changing HTTP method or path
o /users/{id} (GET) → /users/details/{id} (POST).
5. Making optional fields mandatory
o Example: Previously email optional in request → now required.
6. Changing business logic in a way that alters existing behavior
o Example: /orders used to return last 30 days by default, now returns 7
days.
7. Changing error codes / response status codes
o Old clients may depend on 404 but now get 400.
8. Removing query parameters or headers clients use.
􊴘􊴙􊴚􊴛􊶨􊶩􊶪􊶫􊶬 Interview-Ready Summary
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 “Safe, backward-compatible changes are adding new optional params, new fields,
or new endpoints. Breaking changes include removing/renaming fields, changing
response types, mandatory params, or deleting endpoints. If breaking changes are
required, we release them with API versioning (like /v2).”
Would you like me to also make a short table (Breaking vs Non-Breaking) so you can
memorize quickly before an interview?
You said:
IN A search function the response time is too slow, how would you identify the cause
and improve the system
ChatGPT said:
Good one 􈸀􈸁 — this is a classic real-time microservices / system design interview
question. Let’s break it into step 1: identifying the cause and step 2: improving the
system.
􊺎􊺌􊺍 Step 1: Identify the Cause of Slow Search
1. Measure response times with monitoring tools
o Use APM tools (NewRelic, Dynatrace, Prometheus + Grafana, ELK).
o Add tracing (Zipkin/Jaeger) to see which service call is slow.
2. Check DB query performance
o Is the search query doing full table scans?
o Check missing indexes, large joins, sorting, or group by.
o Run EXPLAIN PLAN (Oracle/MySQL/Postgres) to analyze.
3. Check data volume
o Is the search running on millions of rows without caching or indexing?
4. Check service dependencies
o Maybe the API calls other microservices (latency cascade).
5. Check infrastructure bottlenecks
o CPU, memory, network saturation.
o Thread pool exhaustion in microservice.
􎁒 Step 2: Improve the System
Depending on what’s found above:
􈄥􍿁 Database Level
 Add indexes on frequently searched fields.
 Use composite indexes if queries filter on multiple columns.
 Optimize SQL queries → avoid SELECT *.
 Use read replicas to distribute load.
 If text-based search → use full-text search (MySQL FT, PostgreSQL tsvector).
􈄥􍿁 Caching Layer
 Cache frequently used queries/results in Redis / Memcached.
 Use application-level cache for repeated searches.
 Implement Bloom Filters / LRU caches to reduce DB hits.
􈄥􍿁 Search-Specific Optimization
 For advanced searches, use a search engine like Elasticsearch, Solr,
OpenSearch instead of DB LIKE queries.
 Precompute indexes for faster retrieval.
􈄥􍿁 Service Level
 Use asynchronous processing for heavy computations.
 Use pagination & limits (never return thousands of records at once).
 Apply rate limiting / throttling if load spikes.
􈄥􍿁 Infrastructure Level
 Scale database vertically (bigger machine) or horizontally (sharding).
 Scale microservice horizontally with load balancing.
 Use connection pooling for DB.
􊴘􊴙􊴚􊴛􊶨􊶩􊶪􊶫􊶬 Interview-Ready Answer (short)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 “First, I’d identify the bottleneck using tracing and monitoring — whether it’s the DB
query, service dependency, or infrastructure. If it’s the DB, I’d optimize queries, add
proper indexes, or move to a search engine like Elasticsearch. If it’s the service, I’d
introduce caching, async processing, and pagination. Finally, I’d improve scalability
with replicas, load balancing, and caching layers. This way, we improve response time
without breaking existing clients.”
Would you like me to also give you a diagram flow (request → cache → DB → search
engine) so you can sketch it quickly in an interview whiteboard?
You said:
what could be the common reasons a user cannot access its own profile
ChatGPT said:
That’s a good real-time debugging / troubleshooting interview question 􈸀􈸁.
If a user cannot access their own profile (e.g., /users/{id}/profile), there could be
application-level, infra-level, or data-level reasons.
􊺎􊺌􊺍 Common Reasons a User Cannot Access Their Own Profile
1. Authentication Issues
 User is not logged in (missing/expired JWT/session).
 Wrong/missing Authorization header.
 Token expired or revoked.
 Authentication service (Keycloak, OAuth, Cognito, etc.) down.
2. Authorization / Role Issues
 Role-based access control (RBAC) misconfigured → user doesn’t have
READ_PROFILE permission.
 Wrong ACL (Access Control List) mapping (e.g., user A trying to access user B’s
profile mistakenly blocked as self).
3. Incorrect Request
 Wrong user ID passed in the API (e.g., /users/123 instead of /users/456).
 Case-sensitivity or encoding issue in username/email.
4. Data Issues
 User’s profile record missing in DB (account not created properly, deleted, softdeleted).
 Data corruption (foreign key mismatch).
5. Caching Issues
 Outdated cache still showing 403/404.
 Cache key mismatch (wrong tenant/user ID).
6. Application Logic Issues
 Bug in service filtering logic (e.g., WHERE userId = ? condition failing).
 Microservice call to User/Profile service failing.
 Profile service not able to map token → user ID.
7. Infrastructure Issues
 Database connection failure → returning 500.
 Load balancer misrouting request.
 Network/firewall blocking internal calls.
8. Rate Limiting / Throttling
 Too many requests → request blocked by API Gateway (429).
9. Security Policies
 Multi-tenancy rule violation (user in tenant A trying to see tenant B’s profile).
 Geo/IP restrictions.
􊴘􊴙􊴚􊴛􊶨􊶩􊶪􊶫􊶬 Interview-Ready Short Answer
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 “If a user cannot access their own profile, I’d check authentication (token expired,
missing), authorization (RBAC misconfig), request correctness (wrong ID), data
consistency (missing profile), and caching issues. At infra-level, failures like DB
downtime, network, or throttling could also cause it. I’d use logs, tracing, and monitoring
to narrow it down quickly.”
Do you want me to also prepare a step-by-step troubleshooting flow (like: check logs
→ check token → check DB → check caching) that you can tell in interviews as a
systematic approach?
You said:
please explain solid principles in detail
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􋜜􋜝􋜡􋜢􋜞􋜟􋜠 — SOLID principles are very frequently asked in Java +
microservices interviews because they are the foundation of clean code and
maintainable design. Let’s break them down in detail with examples:
􈩙􈩚􈩛􈩜􈩝􈩞 SOLID Principles in Detail
1. S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 A class should have only one reason to change, i.e., it should do only one thing.
 Meaning: Each class/module should handle only one functionality or concern.
 Why: If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one part may break the
other.
􎆡 Bad Example
class UserService {
public void createUser(User user) { ... }
public void sendEmail(User user) { ... } // Not responsibility of UserService
}
􈄥􍿁 Good Example
class UserService {
public void createUser(User user) { ... }
}
class EmailService {
public void sendEmail(User user) { ... }
}
􊺜 Benefit: Easier testing, better readability, low coupling.
2. O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 Meaning: You should be able to add new functionality without modifying existing
code.
 Why: Prevents introducing bugs in stable code.
􎆡 Bad Example
class PaymentService {
public void processPayment(String type) {
if (type.equals("CreditCard")) { ... }
else if (type.equals("UPI")) { ... }
}
}
If a new method (PayPal) comes → we modify the class → risk of breaking existing code.
􈄥􍿁 Good Example (Using Polymorphism / Strategy Pattern)
interface Payment {
void pay();
}
class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
public void pay() { ... }
}
class UpiPayment implements Payment {
public void pay() { ... }
}
class PaymentService {
private Payment payment;
public PaymentService(Payment payment) { this.payment = payment; }
public void processPayment() { payment.pay(); }
}
􊺜 Benefit: Extensible design, no modification needed.
3. L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Subclasses should be replaceable for their parent classes without breaking
behavior.
 Meaning: Derived classes must follow the contract of the base class.
 Why: Prevents unexpected runtime issues when using polymorphism.
􎆡 Bad Example
class Bird {
void fly() { ... }
}
class Ostrich extends Bird {
void fly() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }
}
Ostrich can’t fly → breaks behavior.
􈄥􍿁 Good Example
interface Bird { }
interface FlyingBird extends Bird {
void fly();
}
class Sparrow implements FlyingBird {
public void fly() { ... }
}
class Ostrich implements Bird { }
􊺜 Benefit: Correct hierarchy, avoids violating expectations.
4. I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
 Meaning: Instead of one fat interface, create smaller, role-specific interfaces.
 Why: Prevents “polluted” classes with unused methods.
􎆡 Bad Example
interface Worker {
void work();
void eat();
}
class Robot implements Worker {
public void work() { ... }
public void eat() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }
}
􈄥􍿁 Good Example
interface Workable {
void work();
}
interface Eatable {
void eat();
}
class Human implements Workable, Eatable {
public void work() { ... }
public void eat() { ... }
}
class Robot implements Workable {
public void work() { ... }
}
􊺜 Benefit: Cleaner APIs, avoids forcing unnecessary methods.
5. D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend
on abstractions.
 Meaning: Code should depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations.
 Why: Makes code flexible and testable (via dependency injection).
􎆡 Bad Example
class MySQLDatabase {
public void connect() { ... }
}
class UserService {
private MySQLDatabase db = new MySQLDatabase(); // Tight coupling
}
􈄥􍿁 Good Example
interface Database {
void connect();
}
class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
public void connect() { ... }
}
class UserService {
private Database db;
public UserService(Database db) {
this.db = db;
}
}
􊺜 Benefit: Loose coupling, better for Spring dependency injection, easily switch DB.
􊴘􊴙􊴚􊴛􊶨􊶩􊶪􊶫􊶬 Interview-Ready Summary
 S: One class = one responsibility.
 O: Add new code via extension, not modification.
 L: Subclasses must not break parent’s behavior.
 I: Prefer many small interfaces over a big fat one.
 D: Depend on abstractions, not implementations.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Do you want me to also show you how SOLID principles are applied in real
microservices design (not just Java classes) — e.g., how SRP maps to service
boundaries, how DIP maps to Kafka/event-driven?
You said:
yes please i want to understand that
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈸀􈸁 This is exactly where many interviewers go after checking if you know SOLID
— they ask: “How do SOLID principles apply at the microservices level?”
Let’s map them one by one:
􊺪􊺫 SOLID in Microservices Architecture
1. S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 At service level: Each microservice should handle only one business capability.
 􈄥􍿁 Example:
o UserService → Manages user profiles & authentication.
o OrderService → Manages order creation, updates.
o PaymentService → Handles payments.
 􎆡 Anti-pattern: A God service that does users + orders + payments together.
􊺜 Benefit: Easier scaling (scale payment separately during flash sales), easier
maintenance, clear ownership.
2. O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 At service level: Microservices should be extensible without changing existing
services.
 􈄥􍿁 Example:
If a new payment type (PayPal) is needed:
o Add a new microservice PayPalPaymentService.
o Existing OrderService doesn’t change.
 􎆡 Bad: Changing OrderService code every time a new payment method is
introduced.
􊺜 Benefit: Avoids breaking existing clients, enables feature growth.
3. L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 At service level: Services should respect contracts (APIs).
 􈄥􍿁 Example:
If UserService exposes GET /users/{id}, any new implementation (like v2 using a
new DB) must still return the same expected response format.
 􎆡 Bad: Changing API response structure (e.g., renaming fields) → breaks clients.
􊺜 Benefit: Clients can safely substitute old service with new one. Enables backward
compatibility.
4. I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 At service level: Services should expose focused APIs rather than one bloated API.
 􈄥􍿁 Example:
o UserService exposes only user-related APIs: /users, /users/{id}.
o PaymentService exposes /payments, /refunds.
 􎆡 Bad: A single MegaService exposing all APIs (/users, /orders, /payments) →
hard to use, tightly coupled.
􊺜 Benefit: Clients only depend on the APIs they actually need. More modular.
5. D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 At service level: Services should depend on abstractions (interfaces, events), not
hardcoded implementations.
 􈄥􍿁 Example:
o Instead of OrderService calling PaymentService directly, it publishes an
event: PaymentRequestedEvent.
o Any payment service (Card, UPI, Wallet) can subscribe.
 􎆡 Bad: OrderService tightly coupled to CardPaymentService → hard to change.
􊺜 Benefit: Loose coupling, easier to replace or add services. Works beautifully with
Kafka/Event-driven systems.
􈩙􈩚􈩛􈩜􈩝􈩞 Putting It Together – Example Microservice System
Imagine an e-commerce platform:
 SRP: Each service has one responsibility (User, Order, Payment, Inventory).
 OCP: Add GiftCardPaymentService without touching existing OrderService.
 LSP: Any payment service respects the same contract (/pay, /refund).
 ISP: UserService doesn’t expose order APIs, keeps APIs focused.
 DIP: OrderService publishes OrderCreatedEvent, doesn’t care who consumes it.
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Interview Tip: If asked “How do you ensure SOLID principles in microservices?” →
Answer in this order:
 SRP → service boundaries.
 OCP → adding new services, not modifying old ones.
 LSP → backward compatible APIs.
 ISP → focused APIs, not bloated ones.
 DIP → async event-driven design (Kafka/RabbitMQ).
Would you like me to also prepare a real-time interview scenario question around this
(e.g., “We need to add a new payment method to production without downtime, how do
you design it with SOLID in mind?”) so you can practice answering?
You said:
what are acid principles
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􈸀􈸁 — this is a classic database concept, and interviewers often ask it to
check if you understand transaction guarantees.
􊼡 ACID Principles in Databases
ACID is an acronym for the four key properties of a reliable database transaction:
1. A – Atomicity
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 A transaction is all-or-nothing.
 If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
 Ensures no partial updates.
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 Money transfer: Debit ₹100 from Account A, Credit ₹100 to Account B.
 If credit fails, debit must also roll back.
2. C – Consistency
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state,
maintaining all rules, constraints, and relationships.
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 If a user’s age must always be >= 18, inserting age=12 should never leave the DB
in an invalid state.
3. I – Isolation
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Concurrent transactions should not a􀆯ect each other; results must be as if
transactions were executed sequentially.
 Di􀆯erent isolation levels exist (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed,
Repeatable Read, Serializable).
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 Two people booking the last movie ticket at the same time → only one should
succeed.
4. D – Durability
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent — even if the system
crashes immediately after.
 Usually ensured via write-ahead logs, replication, backups.
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 After booking a ticket and seeing “Booking Confirmed”, the record remains even
after server restart.
􊺪􊺫 Summary
Principle Meaning Example
Atomicity All-or-nothing Debit & credit both succeed or both fail
Consistency Valid state → valid state Constraints always respected
Isolation Transactions don’t interfere Only one person books last ticket
Durability Permanent after commit Data survives crashes
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Interview Tip:
If they ask “Why is ACID important?” →
Say: “It ensures correctness, reliability, and trust in systems where data integrity is
critical, like banking, payments, and e-commerce.”
Would you like me to also cover the opposite concept — BASE (Basically Available,
Soft state, Eventually consistent) — which is often used in microservices and NoSQL
systems?
You said:
hyes please
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈸀􈸁 You already got ACID (used in relational databases for strict correctness).
Now let’s go into BASE — which is very important in distributed systems,
microservices, and NoSQL.
􊼡 BASE Principles
BASE is considered the opposite of ACID.
It comes from the idea that in large distributed systems, strict ACID is often too slow
or even impossible.
So, instead of strict consistency, systems go for availability and scalability.
1. B – Basically Available
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 The system always responds, even if it’s not the most recent data.
 Guarantees high availability.
 Prioritizes system uptime over strict correctness.
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 An e-commerce product page always loads, even if the “stock count” is slightly
outdated.
2. S – Soft State
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 The state of the system may change over time, even without new inputs.
 Because of asynchronous replication across nodes.
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 In a distributed cache, one node may still show an old value until replication
catches up.
3. E – Eventually Consistent
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Data may not be immediately consistent across all replicas, but will converge to
consistency over time.
 Accepts temporary inconsistency for performance and fault tolerance.
􈄥􍿁 Example:
 You update your Facebook profile picture — some friends see the old one for a
few seconds, but eventually everyone sees the new picture.
􊺪􊺫 ACID vs BASE
Feature ACID (SQL/Relational DB) BASE (NoSQL/Distributed DB)
Consistency Strict, immediate Eventual, relaxed
Availability
May sacrifice availability for
consistency
Always available
Use Case Banking, transactions, healthcare
E-commerce, social media, big
data
Speed Slower (locks, strict rules) Faster (looser rules)
Data
Integrity
Guaranteed Best-e􀆯ort
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Interview Tip
If asked “Which one will you use?”:
 ACID → Use when data correctness is critical (banking, payments, healthcare).
 BASE → Use when scalability and availability are more important (social
media, recommendation engines, shopping sites).
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 So think of it this way:
 ACID = Trustworthiness (bank doesn’t lose your money).
 BASE = User Experience (Amazon never goes down, even if stock info lags).
Would you like me to also explain how CAP Theorem connects to ACID vs BASE (since
interviewers often link these)?
You said:
string literal are stored in string constant pool and string object are in heap memory
ChatGPT said:
Exactly 􈸀􈸁 you’re on the right track. Let’s clarify this step by step because this is a
classic Java interview question and often misunderstood.
􊼡 Where are Strings Stored in Java?
1. String Literals → String Constant Pool (SCP)
 When you write:
 String s1 = "Hello";
 String s2 = "Hello";
o Only one object "Hello" is created in the String Constant Pool (SCP)
(inside the heap).
o Both s1 and s2 point to the same object.
o That’s why s1 == s2 → true.
􎆔 Benefit: Saves memory (string interning).
2. new String() Objects → Heap (outside SCP)
 When you write:
 String s3 = new String("Hello");
o Two objects may be created:
1. "Hello" in the SCP (if not already present).
2. A new String object in the heap memory pointing to that "Hello".
o s1 == s3 → false (di􀆯erent references).
􊼡 Diagram
Heap Memory
├── String Constant Pool (SCP)
│ "Hello" ← s1, s2
│
└── Other Heap Objects
[new String("Hello")] ← s3
􊼡 Summary
 String literals → Stored in SCP (special part of heap).
 new String("...") → Creates a new object in heap (outside SCP) + ensures literal
exists in SCP.
 == compares references, .equals() compares values.
􈄥􍿁 Interview-ready statement:
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 “String literals are stored in the String Constant Pool, which is part of the heap
memory. If we use new String(), a new object is always created in the heap, even if the
literal already exists in the SCP.”
Do you want me to also show you a Java code example where == and .equals() behave
di􀆯erently in this context?

hey jvm creates memory area at compile time or run time
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􈷼􈷽􈷾􈷿 — this is often a tricky point in interviews because people confuse
compile-time vs run-time memory handling. Let’s break it down clearly:
􊼡 When are JVM memory areas created?
 The JVM memory model (heap, method area, stack, etc.) is created at run-time,
when the JVM starts.
 At compile time, only the .class bytecode is generated by the compiler — no
memory areas are allocated yet.
􊼡 JVM Memory Areas
When you start your program (e.g., java MyApp), the JVM creates:
1. Method Area (a.k.a. Metaspace in Java 8+)
o Stores class metadata (class names, methods, fields, static variables).
o Created at JVM startup (runtime).
2. Heap Area
o Stores objects, instance variables, String literals (SCP inside heap).
o Created at JVM startup (runtime).
3. Stack Area
o Stores method call frames, local variables, references.
o Created per thread at runtime.
4. PC Register
o Keeps track of current instruction of a thread.
o Created per thread at runtime.
5. Native Method Stack
o Supports execution of native (C/C++) methods.
o Created per thread at runtime.
􊼡 Compile Time vs Runtime
 Compile Time (javac):
o Java source (.java) → Bytecode (.class).
o No JVM memory areas are created.
o Only syntax checks, type checks, and bytecode generation.
 Run Time (java):
o JVM starts → Creates memory areas (Heap, Stack, Metaspace).
o Class loader loads .class files into method area.
o Objects allocated on heap.
o Methods executed on stack.
􈄥􍿁 Interview-ready answer:
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 “The JVM memory areas (heap, stack, method area, PC register, native method
stack) are created at run time, when the JVM starts. At compile time, only bytecode is
generated — no memory allocation happens until execution.”
Would you like me to also make a diagram comparing compile-time vs run-time
activities? That usually makes this answer unbeatable in interviews.
You said:
how can we create custom exception?
ChatGPT said:
Good one 􈸀􈸁 — interviewers often ask this to check if you understand checked vs
unchecked exceptions and how to create your own.
􊼡 Steps to Create a Custom Exception
1. Decide type of exception
o Checked Exception → extend Exception (caller must handle with trycatch
or throws).
o Unchecked Exception → extend RuntimeException (caller may handle,
but not forced).
2. Create a class
o Provide constructors (default, message, cause).
o Optionally add custom fields/methods.
􊼡 Example: Checked Custom Exception
// Custom checked exception
public class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
super(message);
}
}
Usage:
public class Voter {
public void register(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
if (age < 18) {
throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or above to register!");
}
System.out.println("Voter registered successfully!");
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
Voter voter = new Voter();
try {
voter.register(16);
} catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
}
}
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 This forces caller to handle with throws or try-catch.
􊼡 Example: Unchecked Custom Exception
// Custom unchecked exception
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
public ResourceNotFoundException(String message) {
super(message);
}
}
Usage:
public class UserService {
public String getUserById(int id) {
if (id <= 0) {
throw new ResourceNotFoundException("User ID not valid: " + id);
}
return "User-" + id;
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
UserService service = new UserService();
service.getUserById(-1); // No forced try-catch
}
}
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Caller is not forced to handle it, just like NullPointerException.
􈄥􍿁 Interview Tip:
 “If I want to enforce handling (like validation failures), I extend Exception.
If I want to indicate programming errors (like invalid arguments), I extend
RuntimeException.”
Do you want me to also show how custom exceptions are structured in Spring Boot
REST APIs (where we return custom error responses like JSON)? That’s another very
common interview twist.
You said:
and custom annotation
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈷼􈷽􈷾􈷿 — just like custom exceptions, custom annotations are another favorite
interview question.
Let’s go step by step:
􊼡 What is a Custom Annotation?
 An annotation is metadata (information about code).
 Java provides built-in ones like @Override, @Deprecated, @FunctionalInterface.
 You can also define your own for validations, logging, security, etc.
􊼡 Steps to Create a Custom Annotation
1. Define annotation using @interface.
2. Choose retention policy (how long it is kept):
o SOURCE → available only at compile-time.
o CLASS → stored in bytecode but not available at runtime.
o RUNTIME → available at runtime via reflection (most used).
3. Choose target (where it can be applied):
o TYPE → class, interface.
o METHOD → method.
o FIELD → field.
o PARAMETER → method parameters.
􊼡 Example 1: Simple Custom Annotation
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
// Custom annotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) // Available at runtime
@Target(ElementType.METHOD) // Can be applied only on methods
public @interface MyAnnotation {
String value() default "Default Value";
}
Usage
public class Test {
@MyAnnotation(value = "Hello Annotation!")
public void myMethod() {
System.out.println("Executing myMethod()");
}
}
􊼡 Example 2: Processing Custom Annotation via Reflection
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
public class AnnotationProcessor {
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
Class<Test> obj = Test.class;
for (Method method : obj.getDeclaredMethods()) {
if (method.isAnnotationPresent(MyAnnotation.class)) {
MyAnnotation annotation = method.getAnnotation(MyAnnotation.class);
System.out.println("Found annotation on method: " + method.getName());
System.out.println("Value: " + annotation.value());
}
}
}
}
Output
Found annotation on method: myMethod
Value: Hello Annotation!
􊼡 Example 3: Real-World (Validation Annotation)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.FIELD)
public @interface NotEmpty {
String message() default "Field cannot be empty";
}
Usage:
public class User {
@NotEmpty(message = "Username is required")
private String username;
@NotEmpty(message = "Password is required")
private String password;
}
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Later, you can write a validator using reflection to check annotated fields and throw
exceptions if they are empty.
􈄥􍿁 Interview Tip:
 Annotations by themselves do nothing.
 You need processors (reflection, AOP, frameworks like Spring) to act on them.
 In Spring Boot, for example, custom annotations are often paired with AOP or
validators.
Do you want me to also show you how to create a Spring Boot custom annotation with
AOP (like @LogExecutionTime to log method execution time)? That’s one of the most
asked practical interview examples.
You said:
show me a simple code to understand deadlock situation in threads
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􈸀􈸁. Deadlock is one of the classic multi-threading interview topics.
Let me show you a very simple Java program that causes a deadlock between two
threads.
􊼡 Deadlock Example in Java
class Resource {
private final String name;
public Resource(String name) {
this.name = name;
}
public String getName() {
return name;
}
}
public class DeadlockExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Resource resource1 = new Resource("Resource-1");
Resource resource2 = new Resource("Resource-2");
// Thread-1 tries to lock resource1 first, then resource2
Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
synchronized (resource1) {
System.out.println("Thread-1 locked " + resource1.getName());
try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
synchronized (resource2) {
System.out.println("Thread-1 locked " + resource2.getName());
}
}
});
// Thread-2 tries to lock resource2 first, then resource1
Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
synchronized (resource2) {
System.out.println("Thread-2 locked " + resource2.getName());
try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
synchronized (resource1) {
System.out.println("Thread-2 locked " + resource1.getName());
}
}
});
t1.start();
t2.start();
}
}
􊼡 What Happens Here?
1. Thread-1 locks Resource-1, then waits for Resource-2.
2. Thread-2 locks Resource-2, then waits for Resource-1.
3. Both threads wait forever → Deadlock 􎆡.
Sample Output:
Thread-1 locked Resource-1
Thread-2 locked Resource-2
(And then program hangs, because both are waiting.)
􊼡 How to Avoid Deadlock?
1. Always acquire locks in the same order across all threads.
2. Use tryLock() with timeout (from ReentrantLock) instead of synchronized.
3. Minimize the scope of locks.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Would you like me to also show you the fixed version of this code (where deadlock
is avoided by ordering locks properly)?

apply authnetication in your microservices please given in detail answers to these
questions
ChatGPT said:
Awesome set of questions—these are exactly what senior microservices interviews
poke at. I’ll keep it crisp but detailed, with practical checklists and (where useful)
Spring/Java tips.
1) Preventing memory leaks in a microservices project
Common leak sources
 Unclosed resources: DB Connection, ResultSet, streams, HttpClient, file
handles.
 Caches that never evict: in-memory maps, Guava/ConcurrentHashMap, local
LRU without size/TTL.
 Long-lived collections holding requests/responses or large DTOs.
 Listeners/observers not deregistered; thread-locals not cleared.
 Static fields holding references; singletons storing per-request data.
 Reactive chains/subscriptions not disposed.
 Large logs/metrics bu􀆯ers; object pooling misuse.
Prevention checklist
 Always use try-with-resources for anything Closeable:
 try (Connection c = ds.getConnection();
 PreparedStatement ps = c.prepareStatement(sql);
 ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()) { ... }
 Prefer bounded caches with TTL/size limit + metrics; consider Redis instead of
in-JVM.
 Avoid storing request-scoped data in singletons/statics; keep beans stateless.
 Clean up ThreadLocal in finally { threadLocal.remove(); }.
 Use connection pools (HikariCP) with sane max sizes & timeouts.
 In reactive code, dispose subscriptions; use takeUntil, timeout, doFinally.
 Stream large payloads; avoid loading huge blobs in memory (use chunking/backpressure).
 Add memory profiling to CI/CD and pre-prod: Eclipse MAT, YourKit, JFR; write
heap dump on OOM.
 Expose JVM metrics: heap usage, GC pause time, live threads; alert on trends.
 Keep object lifetimes short: avoid global caches for per-request data; prefer
request scope.
 Use Feign/RestTemplate/WebClient with timeouts + connection pooling; close
responses.
2) GC tuning: why it matters and how it a􀆯ects microservices
Why it matters
 GC pauses add latency spikes and can trigger cascading timeouts across
services.
 Mis-sized heap or wrong collector → frequent minor GCs / long full GCs → p99
blows up.
 Over-provisioned heap → slow warm-up, longer GCs, lower density per node
(higher cost).
What to tune (HotSpot examples)
 Choose collector based on latency vs throughput:
o G1 GC (good default for most microservices).
o ZGC/Shenandoah (ultra-low pause, larger heaps).
 Heap sizing: set -Xms = -Xmx to avoid runtime resizing (containers: also respect
cgroup limits).
 Pause time goals (G1): -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 (tune from SLOs).
 Young gen size: let G1 auto-tune; avoid forcing unless measured.
 Container awareness: -XX:+UseContainerSupport (on modern JVMs it’s
default), set -XX:MaxRAMPercentage.
 String dedup (G1): -XX:+UseStringDeduplication for string-heavy services.
How to evaluate
 Track GC logs (JDK 11+: -Xlog:gc*:stdout:tags,uptime,level), JFR events, and
p95/p99 latencies.
 Correlate GC pauses with latency in APM (Grafana/Prometheus, New Relic).
 Load test before prod; tune iteratively—not by guesswork.
3) Applying SOLID principles when defining services & code
At the service boundary (architecture)
 S (Single Responsibility): One business capability per service. E.g.,
BillingService ≠ OrderService.
 O (Open/Closed): Add new features via new endpoints/events/services, not by
changing existing contracts.
 L (Liskov Substitution): Keep API backward compatible; v2 must honor v1
contract or be versioned.
 I (Interface Segregation): Small, focused APIs; don’t expose mega endpoints
that mix concerns.
 D (Dependency Inversion): Depend on abstractions/events (e.g.,
OrderCreated), not concrete downstreams; use ports/adapters.
In the codebase
 SRP classes (controller ↔ service ↔ repo); no God classes.
 Strategy/Factory for pluggable logic (payments, pricing).
 Interfaces for repositories/clients → easy to mock & swap.
 DTOs vs domain models separated; avoid leaking DB entities to controllers.
 Validation, mapping, cross-cutting concerns via AOP/filters (logging, metrics).
4) Securing inter-service communication
Transport security
 mTLS (mutual TLS) between services: both sides authenticate via certs.
 O􀆯load to service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) or configure gateway + sidecars.
 Enforce TLS 1.2+/modern ciphers.
Identity & authorization
 Service identity via SPIFFE/SPIRE or mesh-issued workloads certs.
 JWT (short-lived) or opaque tokens between services; validate signature &
audience.
 Least privilege: scope tokens per service/function; avoid blanket “*” scopes.
Network & runtime
 Zero-trust: deny-all default, only allow explicit service-to-service policies
(NetworkPolicy/SecurityGroups).
 Rate limiting & circuit breakers at gateway/sidecar.
 Secrets management: Vault/Parameter Store/Secrets Manager; never hardcode
secrets.
 Rotate certs/keys automatically; short TTLs.
Observability & compliance
 Log authz decisions (no PII), trace IDs on every hop, security alerts on failed
auth.
5) Securing logins across microservices
Centralized auth
 Use an Identity Provider (Keycloak, Auth0, Cognito, Okta).
 OIDC/OAuth2 with Authorization Code + PKCE for browser/mobile.
 SSO across apps via same IdP + cookie domain policy.
Session/token strategy
 Prefer short-lived access tokens (5–15 min) + refresh tokens (rotated).
 Store refresh tokens securely (HTTP-only, SameSite cookies for browsers).
 For SPAs: consider Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern to avoid token exposure
in JS.
Security controls
 Passwords: salt + strong hash (bcrypt/Argon2), never log/store plaintext.
 MFA/2FA optionality, adaptive risk policies.
 Brute-force protection: rate limiting, lockouts with exponential backo􀆯.
 CSRF protection (cookies) + CORS rules (origins, headers) where applicable.
 Device/session revocation; global logout.
Operational
 Central RBAC/ABAC; roles stored in IdP or a policy engine (OPA).
 Audit trails for login/logout, failed attempts, token refreshes.
6) Applying authentication in microservices
Edge-first
 API Gateway handles authentication (validate tokens, attach claims).
 Downstream services trust gateway (mTLS from gateway to services) and
perform authorization using claims.
Patterns
 JWT access tokens (signed, short TTL), validated by each service (public key via
JWKS).
 Opaque tokens with introspection if you need instant revocation.
 Service-to-service: client credentials flow (machine-to-machine) with leastprivilege
scopes.
Implementation notes (Spring Security)
 Add spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server.
 Configure issuer-uri / jwk-set-uri.
 Use method-level security:
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_orders.read')").
 Map roles/claims from token to authorities via a converter.
 Cache JWKS keys, validate aud, iss, exp, nbf.
Multi-tenant
 Carry tenantId in token claims; enforce row-level filters or tenant-scoped
schemas.
 Validate tenant isolation at data and cache layers.
Revocation & rotation
 Keep tokens short-lived; use refresh token rotation.
 Key rotation (KID in JWT header) and JWKs endpoint support.
Quick action checklists
Performance & reliability
 GC: G1/ZGC, heap sizing per container, GC logs + JFR, tune from p95/p99 SLOs.
 Caching: Redis for shared, bounded in-JVM for local; define TTLs and sizes.
Security
 mTLS + service mesh, OAuth2/OIDC via gateway, short-lived JWTs, least privilege
scopes.
 Secrets in Vault; rotate keys; enforce network policies; rate limit at gateway.
Code quality
 SOLID at service boundary (SRP, contracts, small interfaces, event abstractions).
 Clean separation: controller/service/repo; adapters for external deps; test via
ports.
If you want, I can turn this into a one-page “runbook” (GC, security, auth, leaks) you
can keep handy for interviews or team onboarding.

Great set of advanced microservices interview questions 􈷼􈷽􈷾􈷿
Let’s go through each one step by step with detailed explanations:
1. How will you prevent memory leaks in your microservices project?
􈄥􍿁 Causes of memory leaks in microservices:
 Unclosed database connections, streams, sockets.
 Incorrect caching (e.g., never-expiring cache).
 Static collections holding references.
 Not unsubscribing from listeners/observers.
􈄥􍿁 Prevention techniques:
 Use connection pools (HikariCP for JDBC) and always close connections in
finally or use try-with-resources.
 Monitor memory usage using tools (VisualVM, JConsole, Micrometer,
Prometheus + Grafana).
 Use proper cache eviction policies (LRU, TTL).
 Avoid static references unless absolutely required.
 Use WeakReference/SoftReference for cache if memory-sensitive.
 Implement stress/load testing to detect leaks early.
 Enable JVM options like -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError to debug leaks in
production.
2. How garbage collector (GC) tuning is important and how can it a􀆯ect
microservices?
􈄥􍿁 Why important:
 GC directly a􀆯ects latency and throughput.
 A poorly tuned GC can cause long stop-the-world pauses, degrading API
response times.
􈄥􍿁 Key points for microservices:
 Choose the right GC for workload:
o G1 GC (default in Java 11+) → Good for low-latency microservices.
o ZGC / Shenandoah → Ultra-low pause times for very large heaps.
 Allocate proper heap size (-Xms, -Xmx) based on service needs.
 Monitor GC logs (-Xlog:gc*) and analyze with tools like GCViewer.
 Avoid memory churn (too many short-lived objects).
􈄥􍿁 E􀆯ect on microservices:
 Faster response times → better SLA compliance.
 Prevents OOM (OutOfMemoryError) and crashes.
 Helps optimize autoscaling decisions in Kubernetes.
3. What principles will you follow while defining SOLID principles in microservices?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 SOLID in microservices context:
1. S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
Each microservice should handle one business capability only (e.g., User
Service, Payment Service).
2. O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Code should be extensible without modifying existing code.
Example: Adding new payment methods without changing core Payment Service
logic → use strategy pattern.
3. L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Services or modules should be replaceable without breaking functionality.
Example: Replace MySQL DB with PostgreSQL → service contracts remain same.
4. I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Expose small, specific APIs instead of one giant API.
Example: Separate APIs for user profile update, password reset, etc.
5. D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
Services depend on abstractions (interfaces, contracts), not concrete
implementations.
Example: Use REST/GRPC contracts so services don’t care about underlying DB.
4. How will you secure inter-service communication?
􈄥􍿁 Techniques:
 Use mTLS (mutual TLS): Both client & server authenticate each other with
certificates.
 API Gateway with service-to-service authentication.
 Use OAuth2 / JWT tokens for service communication.
 Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd): Automatically enforces encryption and
authentication.
 Network-level policies (Kubernetes NetworkPolicies / VPC firewall rules).
5. How will you secure logins all over your microservices?
􈄥􍿁 Best Practices:
 Implement Centralized Authentication Service (e.g., Keycloak, Okta, Auth0).
 Use Single Sign-On (SSO) so users log in once for all services.
 Use JWT tokens (access + refresh tokens).
 Secure sensitive data in logs (never log passwords, tokens, PII).
 Apply rate limiting & captcha for login endpoints.
 Always enforce HTTPS.
6. How will you apply authentication in your microservices?
􈄥􍿁 Approaches:
1. Centralized Authentication Service (Auth Service):
o All clients authenticate here.
o Service issues JWT/OAuth2 tokens.
2. API Gateway Authentication:
o Gateway validates tokens before routing requests.
o Prevents each microservice from re-validating tokens.
3. Service-to-Service Authentication:
o Services validate JWTs for each incoming request.
o Use short-lived tokens to reduce misuse.
􈄥􍿁 Implementation Example:
 User logs in → Auth Service returns JWT.
 JWT contains claims (user id, roles, expiry).
 Client attaches JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
 Each microservice validates JWT using public key.
􎁒 In short:
 Prevent memory leaks by closing resources & monitoring.
 Tune GC for low latency in microservices.
 Apply SOLID principles at both code and service level.
 Secure inter-service communication with mTLS / OAuth2 / service mesh.
 Secure logins with central auth + SSO + JWT.
 Authentication → via Auth service + Gateway.
Do you want me to also draw an architecture diagram (Auth Service + Gateway +
Microservices + DB) to visualize Q4–Q6?

Thought for 29s
Awesome set — these are the day-to-day scenarios interviewers love. I’ll go one by one
with practical steps and Spring/Java snippets where it helps.
1) Service Down: 500s with “timeout connecting to DB”
Goal: fix without downtime.
Quick triage (in parallel)
 Check pool metrics (HikariCP): active vs max, pending, timeouts; enable leak
detection.
 DB reachability: security group/VPC rules, DNS, TLS/cert expiry.
 DB health: connections near max_connections, slow queries, locks (SHOW
PROCESSLIST, pg_stat_activity, AWR).
 Thread dumps to see threads blocked on getConnection().
 Actuator: /actuator/health, /actuator/metrics/hikaricp.*, /actuator/threaddump.
Common causes → immediate mitigations
 Pool exhaustion (connections not closed):
o Add/verify try-with-resources and set pool timeouts small (fail fast).
o Temporarily scale out app replicas (spreads waits) and/or increase DB
max connections (if headroom).
 Network/DNS blip:
o Ensure sensible timeouts & retries (below).
 Slow queries / locks:
o Kill o􀆯ending sessions, add missing indexes, use read-only replica for
heavy reads.
Safe configs (HikariCP)
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=20
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=3000 # ms to wait for a connection
spring.datasource.hikari.validation-timeout=2000
spring.datasource.hikari.leak-detection-threshold=5000
spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime=170000 # < DB idle timeout
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=60000
Prevent cascading failure (no downtime)
 Put DB access behind bulkhead + timeout + retry (Resilience4j):
@CircuitBreaker(name="db", fallbackMethod="readOnlyFallback")
@TimeLimiter(name="db") // for async calls
@Retry(name="db")
public CompletionStage<Order> getOrder(UUID id) { ... }
public CompletionStage<Order> readOnlyFallback(UUID id, Throwable t) {
return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> cache.get(id)); // degrade gracefully
}
 Rolling restart only after pool/timeout fixes; keep at least N-1 replicas serving.
 Add readiness probes so bad pods are pulled out of rotation while recovering.
2) Data Consistency: Order shows confirmed, Payment failed (network delay)
Principles
 Use Sagas with eventual consistency and compensation, not XA/2PC.
 Avoid “dual write” with the Outbox pattern.
Flow (Orchestrated Saga)
1. OrderService creates order as PENDING_PAYMENT, writes event to outbox in
same DB txn.
2. Outbox relay publishes OrderCreated → Kafka.
3. PaymentService processes, publishes PaymentSucceeded/Failed.
4. OrderService consumes event:
o success → set CONFIRMED
o failure/timeout → compensation: set CANCELLED and release inventory.
Outbox table (simplified):
CREATE TABLE outbox (
id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
aggregate_id UUID,
type VARCHAR(50),
payload JSONB,
created_at TIMESTAMP
);
Order write (single DB txn):
@Transactional
public UUID createOrder(Order o){
orderRepo.save(o.withStatus(PENDING_PAYMENT));
outboxRepo.save(Outbox.of("OrderCreated", o.getId(), toJson(o)));
return o.getId();
}
This way, if the network glitches, the system retries and state converges.
3) Circuit Breaker: Dependent service is slow
Resilience4j (Spring Boot)
Config
resilience4j:
circuitbreaker:
instances:
productClient:
slidingWindowType: COUNT_BASED
slidingWindowSize: 20
failureRateThreshold: 50

@CircuitBreaker(name="productClient", fallbackMethod="fallback")
@TimeLimiter(name="productClient")
@Retry(name="productClient")
public CompletableFuture<Product> getProduct(String id) {
return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> webClient.get()
.uri("/products/{id}", id).retrieve().bodyToMono(Product.class).block());
}
private CompletableFuture<Product> fallback(String id, Throwable t){
return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(Product.stub(id)); // cached/minimal info
}
Also add a bulkhead if the dependency hangs, to protect your thread pool.
4) Version Compatibility: new version breaks others
Don’t roll back first. Support both versions while clients migrate.
 Run v1 and v2 side-by-side; route via API Gateway:
o /api/v1/** → service v1
o /api/v2/** → service v2
 If the path must stay: use header-based versioning (Accept-Version: 2).
 Backward-compatible DB migrations (expand → migrate → contract).
 Add compatibility shim (adapter) translating v2 responses to v1 for old clients.
 Announce deprecation (headers: Deprecation, Sunset) and set a migration
window.
 Use consumer-driven contract tests (Pact) so future changes don’t rebreak.
5) Kafka: duplicate consumption → duplicate DB rows
Kafka is at-least-once by default. Make consumers idempotent:
Techniques
 Idempotency key in the message (e.g., eventId/orderId), and:
o DB unique constraint on the business key, or
o Maintain a processed_messages table/Redis set.
DB upsert (PostgreSQL)
ALTER TABLE payments ADD CONSTRAINT uq_event UNIQUE (event_id);
INSERT INTO payments(event_id, order_id, amount, status)
VALUES (:eventId, :orderId, :amount, :status)
ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING;
Redis-based dedupe
if (redis.sadd("processed", eventId) == 1) {
// process and write to DB
} else {
log.info("Duplicate message {}", eventId);
}
Strengthen pipeline
 Enable idempotent producer (enable.idempotence=true).
 Use transactional consumer → producer when publishing downstream
(transactional.id).
 Avoid manual commits; use exactly-once semantics (Kafka streams) if you
control the pipeline end-to-end.
6) Database per Service: why not one shared DB?
Shared DB is bad because
 Tight coupling: one schema change breaks many services.
 Hard to scale independently.
 Ownership & data encapsulation violated.
 Cross-service transactions tempt distributed ACID → fragility.
Alternative
 Database-per-service (right store for the job).
 For cross-service reads:
o API composition (aggregator service calls others in parallel).
o CQRS/read models: build a materialized projection by consuming
events (CDC/outbox).
Parallel aggregation (CompletableFuture)
CompletableFuture<User> u = supplyAsync(() -> userClient.get(id));
CompletableFuture<List<Order>> o = supplyAsync(() -> orderClient.list(id));
CompletableFuture<List<Payment>> p = supplyAsync(() -> paymentClient.list(id));
UserProfile profile = allOf(u,o,p).thenApply(v -> merge(u.join(), o.join(), p.join())).join();
7) Service Discovery: registered but cannot be called (Eureka/Consul)
Usual suspects
 Wrong hostname/IP/port registered (preferIpAddress, proxy/NAT).
 Health check failing → instance marked DOWN / not in registry.
 Zone/namespace mismatch; clients looking in the wrong region.
 Firewall/NACL blocks between caller and callee.
 Clock skew causing lease expiry.
 SSL mismatch (HTTP vs HTTPS).
Spring Eureka tips
eureka:
instance:
prefer-ip-address: true
lease-renewal-interval-in-seconds: 10
lease-expiration-duration-in-seconds: 30
client:
serviceUrl:
defaultZone: http://eureka:8761/eureka/
management:
endpoints.web.exposure.include: health,info
 Verify: service lists in Eureka UI; curl http://app:port/actuator/health.
 From caller pod: curl http://<target-ip>:<port> to bypass discovery → isolate
DNS/mesh issues.
8) AuthN/Z between services (without clients passing creds everywhere)
Pattern
 Client authenticates once at API Gateway / BFF (OIDC).
 Gateway validates token → forwards request to services with:
o Short-lived JWT (propagated Authorization header), and/or
o mTLS between services.
 Services act as resource servers (verify JWT signature, audience, scopes).
Spring Security (resource server)
@Bean
SecurityFilterChain security(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
http.oauth2ResourceServer(o -> o.jwt());
http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
.requestMatchers("/actuator/health").permitAll()
.anyRequest().hasAuthority("SCOPE_orders.read"));
return http.build();
}
Feign token propagation
@Bean
public RequestInterceptor bearerForwarder() {
return template -> {
String token = SecurityContextHolder.getContext()
.getAuthentication().getCredentials().toString();
template.header("Authorization", "Bearer " + token);
};
}
Add service mesh mTLS for transport security + identity.
9) Long-running step (~2 minutes) in order flow
Don’t block the client. Make it async.
Pattern A: 202 Accepted + polling
1. Client POST /orders → server enqueues job, returns 202 Accepted + Location:
/orders/{id}/status.
2. Worker processes asynchronously (queue/workflow).
3. Client polls status; or
Pattern B: send webhook/SSE/WS update when done.
Controller sketch
@PostMapping("/orders")
public ResponseEntity<Void> create(@RequestBody OrderRequest r){
UUID id = orderService.enqueue(r); // push to Kafka/SQS
URI statusUri = URI.create("/orders/" + id + "/status");
return ResponseEntity.accepted().location(statusUri).build();
}
@GetMapping("/orders/{id}/status")
public OrderStatus status(@PathVariable UUID id) { return service.statusOf(id); }
Consider Temporal/Camunda for orchestrating long workflows with retries and
visibility.
10) Logging & Tracing: track a request end-to-end
What you need
 Correlation/Trace ID propagated across services (traceparent W3C, or XCorrelation-
Id).
 Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry + collector → Jaeger/Tempo/Zipkin).
 Centralized logs (ELK/EFK) with the ID in every log line.
Simple correlation filter
@Component
public class CorrelationIdFilter implements Filter {
private static final String HDR = "X-Correlation-Id";
public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain)
throws IOException, ServletException {
HttpServletRequest r = (HttpServletRequest) req;
String id =
Optional.ofNullable(r.getHeader(HDR)).orElse(UUID.randomUUID().toString());
MDC.put("corrId", id);
try {
((HttpServletResponse)res).setHeader(HDR, id);
chain.doFilter(req, res);
} finally {
MDC.remove("corrId");
}
}
}
Logback pattern
%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level [%X{corrId}] %logger - %msg%n
OpenTelemetry (Spring Boot 3/Micrometer Tracing)
 Add micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel + opentelemetry-exporter-otlp.
 You get traceId/spanId propagation and spans for HTTP, JDBC, Kafka out of the
box.
Quick reference checklists (copy-paste for interviews)
 Stability: pool timeouts, bulkheads, circuit breaker, retries, caching, readiness
probes.
 Consistency: saga + outbox; never dual-write; idempotent handlers.
 Compatibility: v1 & v2 side-by-side; gateway routing; contract tests;
deprecation headers.
 Security: gateway OIDC, short-lived JWT, mTLS, least-privilege scopes; secrets
rotation.
 Observability: correlation IDs, Otel tracing, centralized logs/metrics; GC & pool
metrics.

configs so you can keep it handy.
You said:
5) Kafka: duplicate consumption → duplicate DB rows 3) Circuit Breaker: Dependent
service is slow Resilience4j (Spring Boot) all answers are very short and just the code is
written , can you please explain more theoritically then practilly bcz I am not able to
understand clearly
ChatGPT said:
Got it 􈸀􈸁 Thanks for clarifying! Since you want a step-by-step explanation first
(theory) and then the code (practice), let’s take the two scenarios you pointed out:
􊼡 5) Kafka: Duplicate Consumption → Duplicate DB Rows
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theoretical Explanation
 Problem:
Kafka follows an at least once delivery guarantee. This means:
o A message might be delivered more than once if the consumer crashes
after processing but before committing the o􀆯set.
o If you directly insert into the DB without handling this, you may end up
with duplicate rows.
 Root causes of duplicates in Kafka consumers:
1. Consumer commits o􀆯set before processing → message is lost if crash happens.
2. Consumer commits o􀆯set after DB insert, but crash happens before commit →
message is reprocessed.
3. No idempotency check in DB (like primary key, unique constraints, or
deduplication logic).
 Solution Approaches:
1. Idempotent Consumers → Ensure same message doesn’t create duplicate DB
rows.
 Add a unique identifier (e.g., transactionId or orderId) in Kafka
messages.
 In DB, enforce uniqueness on that field.
 Before inserting, check if it exists.
2. Exactly-once Semantics (EOS):
 Kafka provides idempotent producers + transactional
consumers (using enable.idempotence=true).
 This ensures a message is processed and committed exactly once.
3. O􀆯set Management:
 Use manual commit of o􀆯sets after successful DB transaction.
 This prevents committing before DB insert.
􈄥􍿁 Practical Example (Spring Boot + Kafka)
@KafkaListener(topics = "orders", groupId = "order-service")
public void consumeOrder(ConsumerRecord<String, OrderEvent> record,
Acknowledgment ack) {
OrderEvent order = record.value();
try {
// Step 1: Check idempotency (avoid duplicate insert)
if (!orderRepository.existsByOrderId(order.getOrderId())) {
orderRepository.save(new OrderEntity(order.getOrderId(), order.getAmount()));
}
// Step 2: Commit o􀆯set only after DB success
ack.acknowledge();
} catch (Exception e) {
// Log & let Kafka retry
log.error("Error processing order: {}", order.getOrderId(), e);
}
}
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Here:
 existsByOrderId ensures we don’t insert duplicates.
 We commit o􀆯set (ack.acknowledge()) only after DB success.
 If service crashes before commit, message will be retried, but DB prevents
duplicates.
􊼡 3) Circuit Breaker: Dependent Service is Slow
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theoretical Explanation
 Problem:
o Imagine your Product Service calls an Inventory Service.
o Inventory is slow (say 5s latency).
o Product Service will also get stuck, consuming threads → cascading
failures → other services fail.
 Solution: Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j or Hystrix):
o Monitors failures & response time of a service.
o If too many failures/slow responses → it “opens the circuit” → stops
making calls for some time.
o During this time, it immediately fails or returns fallback response
(instead of waiting).
o After a cool-down period, it tries again (half-open state).
􎁒 Think of it like an electrical circuit breaker:
 Normal → Current flows.
 Overload → Breaker opens, cutting current.
 Reset → Tries again later.
􈄥􍿁 Practical Example (Spring Boot + Resilience4j)
Service Method:
@Service
public class ProductService {
private final RestTemplate restTemplate;
public ProductService(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {
this.restTemplate = builder.build();
}
@CircuitBreaker(name = "inventoryService", fallbackMethod = "fallbackInventory")
public String getInventoryStatus(String productId) {
String url = "http://inventory-service/api/inventory/" + productId;
return restTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
}
// Fallback method
public String fallbackInventory(String productId, Throwable t) {
return "Inventory information not available right now. Please try later!";
}
}
Configuration (application.yml):
resilience4j:
circuitbreaker:
instances:
inventoryService:
failure-rate-threshold: 50 # 50% failures → open circuit
wait-duration-in-open-state: 10s # Stay open for 10s
permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state: 3
sliding-window-size: 10
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Here:
 If Inventory Service is too slow or fails >50% of the time, the circuit opens.
 Product Service immediately returns fallback → users see a graceful message.
 After 10s, it will retry (half-open).
􈄥􍿁 Summary:
 Kafka duplicates → fix with idempotency + manual o􀆯set + unique keys.
 Circuit Breaker → prevents cascading failures, fallback ensures graceful
degradation.
Would you like me to also create a real-world flow diagram for these two (Kafka
deduplication + Circuit Breaker states) so you can visualize how the flow works?

can you please given anwer to all other questions other than this 5 and 3 like this(since
you have already given good answer for 3 and 5)
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈸀􈸁 now I’ll go through the remaining 8 questions (except 3 and 5, since we
already did) in the same style: theory first → then practical approach/code/config.
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Real-Time Microservices Scenario Questions (Detailed Answers)
􈄥􈄩 Service Down Issue → 500 Error: Timeout connecting to DB
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theory
 Why 500 error? It’s a generic server error. But logs say timeout connecting to DB,
so root cause is DB unavailability (slow, overloaded, wrong credentials, or
network issues).
 Steps to Debug:
1. Check DB connectivity: From service pod/container, try ping/SQL
connection.
2. Connection Pool Exhaustion: If DB is slow, connections pile up →
timeout.
3. Thread Dump / Metrics: Too many waiting threads?
4. Logs + APM Tools (NewRelic, Prometheus, Grafana) to check latency.
 Fix without downtime:
o Apply Retry with backo􀆯 (service retries DB call after waiting).
o Circuit breaker on DB queries if it’s external.
o Increase DB connection pool size (if too low).
o DB index optimization → slow queries cause timeouts.
􈄥􍿁 Practical
@Configuration
public class DataSourceConfig {
@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.hikari")
public DataSource dataSource() {
return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
}
}
spring:
datasource:
hikari:
maximum-pool-size: 20 # Prevent exhaustion
connection-timeout: 3000 # Fail fast instead of hanging
Add Retry:
@Retry(name = "dbRetry", fallbackMethod = "fallbackDb")
public Order findOrder(String id) {
return orderRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow();
}
public Order fallbackDb(String id, Throwable t) {
return new Order("TEMP-" + id, "DB not available, retry later!");
}
􈄥􈄪 Data Consistency → Order Success, Payment Failed
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theory
 Problem: Distributed services → network failures.
 Order placed but payment failed → inconsistent state.
 Patterns to Fix:
1. Saga Pattern (orchestration/choreography):
 Break a transaction into smaller steps.
 If one fails, compensate others (e.g., cancel order if payment fails).
2. Event-driven approach:
 Order Service emits OrderCreated.
 Payment Service processes. If fail → emits PaymentFailed.
 Order Service listens → marks order as canceled.
􈄥􍿁 Practical (Spring Boot + Kafka Saga Example)
// Order Service
public void placeOrder(Order order) {
order.setStatus("PENDING");
orderRepo.save(order);
kafkaTemplate.send("order-events", new OrderEvent(order, "CREATED"));
}
// Payment Service
@KafkaListener(topics = "order-events")
public void processPayment(OrderEvent event) {
try {
paymentGateway.charge(event.getOrder().getAmount());
kafkaTemplate.send("payment-events", new PaymentEvent(event.getOrderId(),
"SUCCESS"));
} catch(Exception e) {
kafkaTemplate.send("payment-events", new PaymentEvent(event.getOrderId(),
"FAILED"));
}
}
// Order Service compensation
@KafkaListener(topics = "payment-events")
public void updateOrder(PaymentEvent event) {
Order order = orderRepo.findById(event.getOrderId()).get();
if(event.getStatus().equals("FAILED")) {
order.setStatus("CANCELLED");
} else {
order.setStatus("CONFIRMED");
}
orderRepo.save(order);
}
􈄥􈄬 Version Compatibility → New API breaks old services
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theory
 Problem: New version changes response structure/fields → clients break.
 Solutions:
o Use backward compatibility → don’t remove fields, mark them
deprecated.
o Support multiple API versions (/v1/orders, /v2/orders).
o Add API Gateway transformation (map old response → new).
􈄥􍿁 Practical
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/orders")
public class OrderControllerV1 {
@GetMapping("/{id}")
public OrderV1 getOrder(@PathVariable String id) {
return new OrderV1(id, "customer123");
}
}
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v2/orders")
public class OrderControllerV2 {
@GetMapping("/{id}")
public OrderV2 getOrder(@PathVariable String id) {
return new OrderV2(id, "customer123", LocalDate.now());
}
}
􈄥􈄯 Database Per Service → Why not a shared DB?
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theory
 Shared DB → tight coupling:
o If one service changes schema → others break.
o Di􀆯icult to scale independently.
 Best Practice → Database per service
o Each microservice owns its DB.
o Services communicate via APIs or events, not direct DB queries.
 Cross-service queries?
o Use CQRS / Event sourcing → replicate needed data via Kafka.
o Or use API composition (aggregate results from multiple services).
􈄥􍿁 Example
 Order Service DB → orders table.
 Customer Service DB → customers table.
 For a query like get customer with all orders:
o API Gateway → calls both services → merges data.
o Or Kafka stream replicates customer data in Order Service DB.
􈄥􈄰 Service Discovery Issue → Eureka/Consul
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theory
 If service is registered but others can’t call it, possible issues:
o Wrong hostname/IP (container IP not reachable).
o Port not exposed.
o Eureka client config wrong (prefer-ip-address).
o Instance not healthy (failing heartbeat).
􈄥􍿁 Practical (Spring Boot Eureka Config)
eureka:
client:
serviceUrl:
defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
instance:
prefer-ip-address: true
lease-renewal-interval-in-seconds: 10
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Debug: Check Eureka Dashboard → verify IP/port → check health endpoint
/actuator/health.
􈄥􈄱 Authentication Between Services
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theory
 Don’t let clients pass credentials to every service.
 Use service-to-service authentication (machine identity).
 Approaches:
o OAuth2 + JWT: Each request has JWT token validated by services.
o mTLS (Mutual TLS): Each service has a certificate → mutual trust.
o API Gateway + Identity Provider (Keycloak, Okta) → central
authentication.
􈄥􍿁 Practical (Spring Security + JWT)
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
return http.csrf().disable()
.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth.anyRequest().authenticated())
.oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2.jwt())
.build();
}
All services validate JWT token issued by Identity Provider.
􈄥􈄲 Long Running Processes (2-min order step)
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theory
 Don’t keep client waiting!
 Solutions:
o Async processing: Place request → return 202 ACCEPTED.
o Process in background (via Kafka/Queue).
o Client polls status (GET /order/{id}/status) or server pushes via
WebSocket.
􈄥􍿁 Practical
@PostMapping("/orders")
public ResponseEntity<String> createOrder(@RequestBody OrderRequest req) {
String orderId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
kafkaTemplate.send("order-requests", new OrderEvent(orderId, req));
return ResponseEntity.accepted().body(orderId); // return immediately
}
@GetMapping("/orders/{id}/status")
public OrderStatus getStatus(@PathVariable String id) {
return orderRepo.findById(id).map(Order::getStatus).orElse("PENDING");
}
􈄥􊻈􊻉 Logging & Tracing (Distributed logs)
􍩯􍩰􍩱 Theory
 Problem: Logs scattered → can’t trace a request across multiple services.
 Solution: Distributed tracing.
o Use Correlation ID (UUID generated at API Gateway).
o Pass it in headers (X-Correlation-ID) to all services.
o Log it in every service.
 Tools: Spring Sleuth + Zipkin/Jaeger.
􈄥􍿁 Practical (Spring Sleuth)
spring:
sleuth:
sampler:
probability: 1.0 # trace all requests
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Sleuth auto-injects traceId and spanId in logs.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Zipkin UI shows full request journey across services.
􈄥􍿁 Summary
 500 errors → check DB connectivity, pooling, retries
 Data consistency → Saga pattern with compensation
 Versioning → backward compatibility or /v1 /v2 APIs
 DB per service → avoid shared DB, use events/APIs for joins
 Service discovery → check Eureka config & health
 Auth → JWT or mTLS, not client credentials
 Long tasks → async with Kafka + polling
 Logs → distributed tracing (Sleuth + Zipkin/Jaeger)

ChatGPT said:
Awesome set! I’ll walk through each scenario in two layers:
(A) Design/theory — what & why; (B) Practical sketch — how you’d implement it
(Spring/Java/Kafka-ish where useful).
1) Saga Pattern Implementation (step-2 fails → global rollback)
A) Design / theory
 Avoid XA/2PC. Use Saga:
o Orchestration: a central Saga orchestrator commands services, listens
to outcomes, triggers compensation if any step fails.
o Choreography: services react to events; each step publishes an event;
failures publish …Failed events that trigger compensating events
downstream.
 Compensating transactions are business rollbacks (e.g., “unreserve inventory”,
“refund payment”), not database rollbacks.
B) Practical sketch
 Steps: CreateOrder(PENDING) → ReserveInventory → CapturePayment. Step-2
fails.
 Orchestrator flow (Temporal/Camunda or homegrown):
1. OrderService: create PENDING, write Outbox OrderCreated.
2. InventoryService: on OrderCreated → try reserve; on failure → publish
InventoryReservationFailed.
3. Orchestrator/OrderService: on failure → trigger compensation: cancel
order; if payment taken earlier, publish RefundRequested.
 Ensure idempotency on all handlers; keep status state machine per aggregate
(PENDING → CONFIRMED/CANCELLED).
2) Eventual Consistency vs Strong Consistency
A) Design / theory
 Strong consistency: reads reflect latest write; great for correctness, slower/less
available.
 Eventual consistency: replicas catch up asynchronously; higher
availability/throughput; temporary staleness.
When to choose
 Payments/ledger: strong (or bounded staleness) for balances, double-entry
ledger, idempotent operations, serializable isolation, or ACID inside a single
service.
 Social posts/feeds: eventual; write to primary, fan-out or materialize
asynchronously; users tolerate delay.
B) Practical sketch
 Payments: single-writer ledger table; ACID within service, external updates via
Outbox + events; consumers build read models (eventual externally).
 Social: write post → enqueue; feed service materializes asynchronously; UI
shows “syncing…” until ready.
3) Blue-Green & Canary Deployment (zero downtime, safe rollback)
A) Design / theory
 Blue-Green: two identical stacks (Blue live, Green idle). Deploy to Green → run
smoke/E2E → flip tra􀆯ic. Rollback = flip back.
 Canary: shift small % of tra􀆯ic to the new version; observe SLOs; gradually ramp
up; auto-rollback on SLO breach.
B) Practical sketch
 Kubernetes + Istio/NGINX:
o Canary: VirtualService with weighted routes (1%→5%→25%→100%).
Automated via Argo Rollouts/Flagger using Prometheus SLOs (p95
latency, error rate).
o Blue-Green: two Deployments behind Service; switch Service selector or
Ingress route; DB migrations follow expand → migrate → contract.
4) API Gateway Design (15 services: routing, auth, rate-limit)
A) Design / theory
 Gateway responsibilities:
o Routing (path/host based), authN (OIDC/OAuth2), authZ (claims/RBAC),
rate limiting, request/response transform, observability.
 Keep services dumb (resource servers) and stateless; gateway centralizes
cross-cutting concerns.
B) Practical sketch
 Tools: Kong/Apigee/NGINX/Istio Gateway/Spring Cloud Gateway.
 Configure:
o OIDC: validate JWT, inject claims headers.
o Rate limit: per API key/tenant.
o Caching for GETs, circuit breaker/timeouts.
o Correlation IDs & tracing headers propagated.
5) Bulkhead Pattern (one overloaded service must not sink others)
A) Design / theory
 Isolate resources so failure/latency in one path doesn’t exhaust shared pools:
o Thread-pool bulkheads per dependency.
o Connection pools per downstream.
o Queues with bounded size per work type.
o Pair with timeouts, circuit breakers, rate limits.
B) Practical sketch
 Spring + Resilience4j:
o Define Bulkhead/Semaphore for inventoryClient with max concurrent
calls.
o Separate WebClient connection pools per host.
o Dedicated executor per use case; never use a single global pool.
6) Distributed Transactions Without 2PC
A) Design / theory
 Use Saga + Outbox + Idempotency:
o Each service performs local ACID and writes an outbox event in the
same transaction.
o A relay publishes events (Kafka).
o Downstream services apply changes idempotently (upsert/unique keys).
o Compensations handle business rollback.
B) Practical sketch
 DB schema: orders, outbox.
 On write: INSERT order, INSERT outbox in one txn.
 Debezium/relay publishes; consumers do UPSERT with unique event_id
constraint to avoid duplicates.
7) Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
A) Design / theory
 DLQ stores messages that repeatedly fail processing (poison messages).
 Prevents infinite retries blocking the main queue; enables later
inspection/replay.
 Use retry policy: finite attempts + backo􀆯 → then DLQ.
B) Practical sketch
 Kafka: use a separate topic.dlq; producer sends to DLQ after N retries or on nonretryable
errors.
 RabbitMQ: queue with x-dead-letter-exchange; after TTL or max-retries,
message is routed to DLQ.
 Consumers expose a manual replay tool; always ensure idempotency when
replaying.
8) Service Communication Choice (REST vs gRPC vs Messaging)
A) Design / theory
 Synchronous REST (HTTP/JSON): human-friendly, broad ecosystem; higher
overhead; best for request/response, user-facing APIs, cross-org.
 gRPC (HTTP/2, Protobuf): low-latency, streaming, strongly typed; great for
service-to-service in the same org; code-gen.
 Asynchronous messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ): decoupling, bu􀆯ering, eventdriven,
retries; best for event propagation, batch, long-running or fan-out.
Decision cues
 Need immediate result? → sync (gRPC for perf).
 Need decoupling, spikes smoothing, saga/events? → async.
 Mobile/public API? → REST.
B) Practical sketch
 Internal calls: gRPC for hot paths; REST where simplicity wins.
 Cross-service workflows: Kafka.
 API Gateway at edge: REST/GraphQL.
9) Database Sharding & Scaling
A) Design / theory
 Vertical scale hits a ceiling. Move to:
o Read replicas (scale reads), caching.
o Partitioning (intra-DB).
o Sharding (inter-DB) by consistent key (e.g., tenant_id, user_id), or
range/hash.
 Challenges: rebalancing, global queries, hot shards, transactions across
shards.
B) Practical sketch
 Pick shard key aligned with access patterns (avoid cross-shard joins).
 Shard map (service or catalog) → route requests.
 Online re-sharding: double-write or streaming copy; read-through to new shard
when caught up.
 Use CQRS for global reports (build aggregated read models from events).
 Always design idempotent upserts and per-shard unique constraints.
􈄥􊻈􊻉 Resiliency Testing (Chaos Engineering)
A) Design / theory
 Intentionally inject failures to validate SLOs and fallbacks:
o Kill pods, add latency, drop packets, corrupt DNS, fail dependencies.
 Guardrails: run in non-peak windows, blast-radius control, automated abort
on SLO breach.
B) Practical sketch
 Tools: Chaos Mesh, Litmus, Gremlin, Istio fault injection.
 Experiments:
o Add 500ms latency to inventory for 5% tra􀆯ic → confirm circuit breaker +
fallback kicks in, p95 within SLO.
o Kill 1 replica → verify autoscaler replaces it, no error-rate spike.
o Break DNS for dependency → verify retries + backo􀆯 and alerting.
 Wire results to CI/CD gating (don’t promote if chaos tests fail).
Tiny Implementation Nuggets (copy-ready)
 Resilience4j bulkhead/circuit/timeout
resilience4j:
bulkhead:
instances:
inventory: { maxConcurrentCalls: 20, maxWaitDuration: 100ms }
circuitbreaker:
instances:
inventory: { failureRateThreshold: 50, slidingWindowSize: 20,
waitDurationInOpenState: 10s }
timelimiter:
instances:
inventory: { timeoutDuration: 2s }
 Idempotent consumer UPSERT (Postgres)
ALTER TABLE payments ADD CONSTRAINT uq_event UNIQUE (event_id);
INSERT INTO payments(event_id, order_id, amount, status)
VALUES (:eventId, :orderId, :amount, :status)
ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING;
 Outbox table (simplified)
CREATE TABLE outbox(
id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
aggregate_id UUID NOT NULL,
type VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
payload JSONB NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
Wrap-up
 Sagas + Outbox + Idempotency: backbone of cross-service correctness.
 Gateways, bulkheads, circuit breakers, and canaries: backbone of reliability.
 Pick comms wisely (REST/gRPC/messaging), and scale data with sharding +
CQRS.
 Prove it with chaos and observability (traces, metrics, logs).
If you want, I can bundle these into a one-page architectural cheat sheet (with a couple
of diagrams) you can revise before interviews.
You said:
i did not understand ans 9 and 10 , please exaplin
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈸀􈸁 let’s go step by step. You asked about Q9 (Database Sharding and Scaling)
and Q10 (Resiliency Testing / Chaos Engineering). I’ll break them down slowly, with
examples + reasoning so you understand the concepts clearly.
9) Database Sharding and Scaling
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Problem:
Suppose your microservice (say UserService) has a single DB table with 100M user
records. Queries (search, update) are slowing down. Your DB server has reached its
storage and performance limits.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Solution: Sharding
Sharding means splitting one large database into smaller, independent parts
(shards), each handling a subset of data.
􊼡 How to Shard
 Vertical Sharding (by feature):
o Split tables by purpose.
o Example: One DB for UserProfile, another DB for UserOrders.
 Horizontal Sharding (by data range / key):
o Split rows of the same table.
o Example:
 Shard 1 → Users with ID 1–10M
 Shard 2 → Users with ID 10M–20M
 Shard 3 → Users with ID 20M–30M
 Hash-based Sharding:
o Assign a shard using a hash function on a key (like userId % 4 → goes to
shard 0–3).
o Ensures even distribution of load.
􊼡 How to Keep Availability During Scaling
When one shard becomes too large, you add another shard and redistribute.
 Use a Shard Manager / Routing Layer (middleware or library that knows where
data lives).
 Examples:
o Proxy layer (like Vitess, Yugabyte, Citus for Postgres).
o Application-level routing (you compute shard based on userId in code).
􊼠 Availability techniques:
 Replication: Each shard has replicas (Primary for write, Secondary for read). If
one fails → tra􀆯ic goes to replica.
 Partition-Aware Load Balancer: Client routes to correct shard.
 Online Resharding: Move data in background with minimal downtime (using
tools like Debezium, Kafka CDC).
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Summary in an Interview
“We’ll scale the DB with horizontal sharding (e.g., by userId hash). Each shard will be
replicated for HA. Application uses a shard-routing layer, so queries go to the correct
shard automatically. For resharding, we use CDC tools to migrate data online, ensuring
availability during scaling.”
10) Resiliency Testing (Chaos Engineering)
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Problem:
We designed our microservices to be resilient (retry, circuit breakers, DLQ, etc.), but
how do we know if they actually survive failures in real-world production?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Solution: Chaos Engineering
Intentionally inject failures into the system and observe if it still works.
􊼡 What We Test
 Kill random service pods (see if tra􀆯ic reroutes).
 Introduce latency in one service (see if circuit breakers trigger).
 Drop Kafka messages (see if DLQ works).
 Crash a DB replica (see if failover happens).
􊼡 Tools
 Chaos Monkey (Netflix): Randomly shuts down instances.
 Gremlin / LitmusChaos: Injects latency, packet loss, CPU spike.
 Kube-monkey: For Kubernetes pods.
􊼡 Example
Say we have:
 OrderService → PaymentService → DB
Test Case: What if PaymentService becomes very slow?
 Inject 5s delay into PaymentService.
 Expected Behavior:
o OrderService times out after 2s.
o Circuit breaker opens.
o Fallback: Order is marked as “Payment Pending” instead of failing.
If instead the system keeps retrying until DB crashes, then our resilience design is
broken.
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Summary in an Interview
“We use Chaos Engineering to verify resilience. For example, we inject failures like pod
shutdowns, DB crashes, or network latency. Tools like Gremlin or Chaos Monkey
simulate failures in production. We expect the system to degrade gracefully (e.g., circuit
breakers open, retries move to DLQ). This ensures our system is fault-tolerant before
real outages happen.”
􈄥􍿁 So in simple words:
 Q9 (Sharding): Break DB into smaller pieces (horizontal/vertical/hash). Keep
replicas + routing layer for availability.
 Q10 (Chaos Engineering): Intentionally break system (kill pods, delay
responses, drop messages) to see if fallback/resilience patterns actually work.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Do you want me to draw a small diagram for sharding (Q9) so you can visually see
how user data is split across shards?

like wise now can you give me a list of kafka based interview questions for my
experience level ie 5 years and also explain with code bcz I have not personally worked
on kafka lately
ChatGPT said:
Got it 􈄥􍿁 — you’re preparing for Kafka interview questions at 5 years of experience,
where interviewers won’t just ask theory, they’ll check real-world usage +
troubleshooting.
I’ll give you a list of common Kafka interview questions, then for each I’ll explain
concept + practical code (in Java/Spring Boot, since you’re already working with that).
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Kafka Interview Questions (5 Years Experience Level)
1. Kafka Basics
􊼡 What are Kafka Topics, Partitions, Brokers? Why is Kafka fast?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Topic: logical stream of messages (like a table).
 Partition: topic split into multiple logs (enables parallelism).
 Broker: Kafka server that stores partitions.
 Kafka is fast because it uses sequential disk writes + zero-copy I/O.
2. Producer Acknowledgements (acks)
􊼡 What does acks=0,1,all mean?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 acks=0: fire and forget (fast, unsafe).
 acks=1: leader writes acknowledged (medium safety).
 acks=all: wait for leader + replicas to ack (slow, safest).
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Code Example:
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, "all"); // safest
props.put(ProducerConfig.RETRIES_CONFIG, 3); // retry if fails
props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("orders", "order1", "Order Created"));
producer.close();
3. Consumer Group & O􀆯set Management
􊼡 How does Kafka guarantee that a message is consumed once? What if a consumer
crashes?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Kafka tracks o􀆯sets per consumer group in __consumer_o􀆯sets topic.
 If consumer crashes → another consumer in same group takes over → resumes
from last committed o􀆯set.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Spring Boot Example:
@KafkaListener(topics = "orders", groupId = "order-group")
public void consume(String message) {
System.out.println("Consumed: " + message);
}
 groupId ensures load balancing between consumers.
 Commit strategy:
o enable.auto.commit=true → Kafka commits o􀆯sets automatically.
o Manual commit → safer for exactly-once processing.
4. Exactly Once Processing
􊼡 How do you avoid duplicate DB inserts from Kafka?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Enable idempotence in producer.
 Use transactional producer + consumer → ensures atomic write to Kafka + DB.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Code Example:
props.put(ProducerConfig.ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCE_CONFIG, "true");
props.put(ProducerConfig.TRANSACTIONAL_ID_CONFIG, "txn-1");
producer.initTransactions();
try {
producer.beginTransaction();
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("payments", "pmt1", "Payment Processed"));
// also write to DB here
producer.commitTransaction();
} catch (Exception e) {
producer.abortTransaction();
}
5. Kafka Message Ordering
􊼡 How does Kafka guarantee message order?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Order is guaranteed within a partition, not across partitions.
 Use same key → ensures same partition → order preserved.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Code Example:
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("orders", "user123", "Order1"));
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("orders", "user123", "Order2"));
// Both go to same partition (same key)
6. Kafka Rebalance Issue
􊼡 What happens when a new consumer joins/leaves a group?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Kafka rebalances partitions across consumers.
 During rebalance → no messages are consumed (downtime risk).
 Fix: Use sticky partition assignment + tune session.timeout.ms.
7. Kafka Retention & Log Compaction
􊼡 How does Kafka handle old data?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Retention: delete messages after X time/size.
 Log compaction: keeps only the latest record per key (like a DB).
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Config Example:
retention.ms=604800000 # keep for 7 days
cleanup.policy=compact # keep latest value per key
8. Kafka Error Handling (DLQ)
􊼡 What if consumer keeps failing for same message?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Use Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) → failed messages go to a separate topic.
 Avoid infinite retries.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Spring Boot Example:
@KafkaListener(topics = "orders", groupId = "order-group")
public void consume(String message) {
try {
processOrder(message);
} catch (Exception e) {
kafkaTemplate.send("orders.DLQ", message); // move to DLQ
}
}
9. Kafka vs RabbitMQ
􊼡 When would you use Kafka vs RabbitMQ?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Kafka → high throughput, event streaming, replay capability.
 RabbitMQ → low-latency message queue, request-response.
 Example: Kafka for Order events, RabbitMQ for stock reservation commands.
10. Monitoring Kafka
􊼡 How do you monitor Kafka health?
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Answer Concept:
 Metrics: lag, partition distribution, broker health.
 Tools: Prometheus + Grafana, Confluent Control Center, Kafka Exporter.
􈄥􍿁 Quick Recap (Interview Level)
At 5 years experience, you should be able to answer:
 Producer reliability (acks, retries, idempotence).
 Consumer group & o􀆯set handling.
 Exactly-once semantics (transactions).
 Message ordering within partitions.
 Error handling with DLQ.
 Rebalancing and tuning.
 Di􀆯erence with RabbitMQ.
 Monitoring + scaling partitions.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Do you want me to also prepare a set of real-world Kafka debugging scenarios
(like "consumer lag too high" or "duplicate messages in DB") so you can practice both
theory + troubleshooting like in real interviews?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 􈷼􈷽􈷾􈷿 — I’ll take the 10 most important Kafka real-time scenario questions from
that list and explain them in detail:
1. Consumer Lag Issue
2. Duplicate Messages in DB (Exactly Once Processing)
3. Message Ordering Problem
4. Rebalance Impact
5. Poison Pill Messages (DLQ)
6. Producer Reliability
7. Kafka Topic Growing Too Large (Retention Strategy)
8. Consumer Group with Multiple Microservices
9. At-Least-Once vs Exactly-Once Tradeo􀆯
10. O􀆯set Reset Strategy
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Detailed Kafka Scenario Explanations
1. Consumer Lag Issue
Problem: Your consumer lag (di􀆯erence between latest message in Kafka and
consumer’s committed o􀆯set) keeps increasing.
Root Causes:
 Consumer is slower than producer (slow DB writes, expensive processing).
 Too few consumers for partitions.
 Bad partitioning (some partitions hot, others idle).
 Consumer stuck in GC pauses or retry loops.
Fixes:
 Scale out consumers → Add more consumers in same group (only if topic has
enough partitions).
 Optimize processing → Use batch inserts, async writes.
 Monitor lag with Prometheus + Grafana + Kafka Exporter.
Code Fix Example: Batch processing in Spring Kafka
@KafkaListener(topics = "orders", containerFactory = "batchFactory")
public void consume(List<String> messages) {
orderService.saveAll(messages); // batch DB insert
}
2. Duplicate Messages in DB (Exactly Once Processing)
Problem: Sometimes a Kafka message is consumed twice → duplicate DB rows.
Why:
 Consumer crashes after processing but before committing o􀆯set.
 Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery by default.
Fix Options:
1. Idempotency in DB layer (best): use unique keys (e.g., order_id).
2. Transactional Consumer with Kafka + DB (Spring Kafka + Transaction Manager).
Spring Kafka Exactly-Once Example:
factory.getContainerProperties().setAckMode(ContainerProperties.AckMode.RECORD);
factory.getContainerProperties().setTransactionManager(txManager);
@KafkaListener(topics = "orders")
@Transactional
public void consume(Order order) {
orderRepository.save(order); // DB insert
}
Here o􀆯set is committed only if DB transaction succeeds → no duplicates.
3. Message Ordering Problem
Problem: Events are consumed out of order.
Why:
 Kafka guarantees order only within a partition, not across partitions.
 If you use a random partition key, ordering breaks.
Fix:
 Choose a partition key logically (e.g., customerId for all events of a customer).
 If strict order across all messages is needed → only 1 partition (but limits
throughput).
Producer Example (Partition by customerId):
ProducerRecord<String, String> record =
new ProducerRecord<>("orders", customerId, orderJson);
producer.send(record);
4. Rebalance Impact
Problem: When a new consumer joins a group, all partitions are rebalanced →
downtime for seconds/minutes.
Why:
 Kafka pauses processing during rebalance.
 Consumers reassign partitions → delays.
Fixes:
 Use incremental cooperative rebalancing (PartitionAssignor =
CooperativeStickyAssignor).
 Avoid frequent consumer crashes/restarts.
 Set longer session.timeout.ms to avoid unnecessary rebalances.
Spring Boot Config:
spring.kafka.consumer.properties.partition.assignment.strategy:
org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.CooperativeStickyAssignor
5. Poison Pill Messages (DLQ)
Problem: A malformed message keeps failing (e.g., bad JSON). Consumer retries
forever → blocks partition.
Fix:
 Send bad messages to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) after max retries.
 Continue processing other messages.
Spring Kafka Example with DLQ:
@Bean
public DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer recoverer(KafkaTemplate<?, ?> template) {
return new DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer(template, (r, e) -> new
TopicPartition("orders.DLQ", r.partition()));
}
@Bean
public DefaultErrorHandler errorHandler(DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer recoverer) {
return new DefaultErrorHandler(recoverer, new FixedBackO􀆯(1000L, 3)); // 3 retries
}
6. Producer Reliability
Problem: Producer sends a message, but it gets lost.
Why:
 By default, producer doesn’t wait for broker ack.
 Network failure before broker write.
Fix:
 Use acks=all → wait for leader + replicas.
 Enable idempotent producer → no duplicates.
Producer Config:
props.put(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, "all");
props.put(ProducerConfig.ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCE_CONFIG, "true");
props.put(ProducerConfig.RETRIES_CONFIG, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
7. Kafka Topic Growing Too Large (Retention Strategy)
Problem: Topic storage reached terabytes → brokers crash.
Fix:
 Configure retention policy:
o retention.ms → keep messages only for X days.
o retention.bytes → delete when size exceeds.
 If historical data is needed → sink to external storage (S3, HDFS).
Config:
kafka-topics.sh --alter --topic orders \
--config retention.ms=604800000 # keep 7 days
8. Consumer Group with Multiple Microservices
Problem: You have multiple microservices consuming same topic. One misses
messages.
Why:
 Consumers in the same group share messages (load balancing).
 If you want all microservices to get all messages, each must have its own
group.id.
Fix:
 Assign unique group IDs for each service.
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id: order-service-group
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id: payment-service-group
9. At-Least-Once vs Exactly-Once Tradeo􀆯
Problem: Payment system must not process twice.
 At-Least-Once → safer for availability, may cause duplicates.
 At-Most-Once → faster, but may lose messages.
 Exactly-Once → expensive but ensures no duplicates (requires idempotency +
transactions).
Fix in Payments: Use idempotency (unique transaction_id in DB).
Fix in Social Media: At-least-once is fine (2 likes not critical).
10. O􀆯set Reset Strategy
Problem: Consumer was down for 2 days. Should it reprocess old events or start fresh?
Kafka Configs:
 auto.o􀆯set.reset=earliest → read from beginning.
 auto.o􀆯set.reset=latest → skip old, read only new.
Real Use Cases:
 Payments → use earliest (must reprocess).
 Analytics → use latest (only care about new data).
spring.kafka.consumer.auto-o􀆯set-reset: earliest
􈄥􍿁 Summary (What you should remember for interviews)
 Consumer lag → fix with scaling + batching.
 Duplicates → use idempotent DB or transactions.
 Ordering → partition by key.
 Rebalancing → use cooperative assignor.
 Poison pills → DLQ strategy.
 Producer reliability → acks=all + idempotence.
 Retention → limit with retention.ms/bytes.
 Consumer groups → unique group IDs per service.
 Consistency tradeo􀆯 → payments need exactly-once; analytics can do at-leastonce.
 O􀆯set reset → choose based on use case.
o String s2 = new String("Hello"); // stored in Heap (outside pool)If "Hello"
already exists in SCP, s1 will reuse it.
o new String("Hello") always creates a new object in heap, even if SCP has
the same literal.
 Memory E􀆯iciency:
o String Pool avoids duplication.
o For example,
o String s1 = "Java";
o String s2 = "Java"; // Both point to same pool object
o System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true
 Performance Concern:
o Since Strings are immutable, concatenations (+) create new objects.
o To improve performance, StringBuilder or StringBu􀆯er is used when
frequent modifications are needed.
2. Use Case
 Identifiers: Usernames, passwords, email IDs (immutable for safety).
 Text Manipulation: Processing files, parsing logs, handling messages.
 Database Queries: Constructing SQL queries or request payloads.
 Communication: JSON/XML/HTTP responses are handled as Strings.
Example in Java:
public class StringExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "World";
// Concatenation
String result = str1 + " " + str2;
// Checking equality
System.out.println(result); // Hello World
System.out.println(str1.equals("Hello")); // true
}
}
3. Summary (with Performance Details)
 Immutable → Safer and reusable, but costly for modifications.
 Stored in String Pool → Saves memory by reusing literals.
 Best Practices:
o Use StringBuilder for frequent concatenation.
o Use equals() for content comparison (not ==).
 Time Complexity:
o Access by index: O(1)
o Concatenation (+) on String: O(n) (because new object is created)
o Concatenation with StringBuilder: O(1) amortized
􈄥􍿁 String = Immutable sequence of characters stored in String Pool (if literal), with
e􀆯icient reuse but slower modifications.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Do you want me to also cover StringBuilder vs StringBu􀆯er vs String in the same

ChatGPT said:
Great set of questions 􈸀􈸁 Let’s go through them one by one with clear explanation +
reasoning + examples.
1. Moving from Monolithic DB → Separate DB per Microservice (Safe Data Migration)
Explanation
In a monolithic application, you usually have one central DB. In microservices, each
service owns its separate DB (to ensure loose coupling).
􈄥􍿁 Steps for Safe Migration:
1. Domain Decomposition:
o Identify bounded contexts (Order, Payment, Inventory).
o Split tables/entities based on ownership.
2. Data Duplication if Required:
o Some services may need overlapping data (like user_id in Orders &
Payments).
o Use event-driven replication (Kafka) to sync.
3. Data Migration Plan:
o Create migration scripts to export monolith DB data into new service DBs.
o Run ETL jobs (Extract, Transform, Load).
4. Zero-Downtime Strategy:
o Run in parallel read mode → Both monolith DB & microservice DB for a
while.
o Switch tra􀆯ic only after verification.
5. Consistency Assurance:
o Use event sourcing or change-data-capture (CDC) tools (Debezium).
o Validate migrated data with checksums.
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Example:
 orders table from monolith → goes to Order Service DB.
 payments table → Payment Service DB.
 During migration, new orders are published as Kafka events → both old
monolith DB and new service DB get updated until cutover.
Summary
Safe migration = domain-driven split + parallel run + event-driven sync + verification.
2. Life Cycle of a Thread in Java

A thread in Java goes through several states (from Thread.State enum).
Lifecycle States:
1. New → Thread object created but start() not called yet.
2. Runnable → After start(), thread is ready to run but waiting for CPU scheduling.
3. Running → Thread scheduler picks it, and run() executes.
4. Waiting → Thread waits indefinitely until another thread signals (via notify()).
5. Timed Waiting → Thread waits for a fixed time (sleep(1000), join(5000)).
6. Terminated → After run() completes.
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Example Code:
class MyThread extends Thread {
public void run() {
System.out.println("Thread is running...");
}
}
public class ThreadLifeCycle {
public static void main(String[] args) {
MyThread t = new MyThread();
System.out.println(t.getState()); // NEW
t.start();
System.out.println(t.getState()); // RUNNABLE
}
}
Summary
Thread moves: NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → WAITING/TIMED_WAITING →
TERMINATED.
3. What if we add another abstract method inside a Functional Interface?
Explanation
 A Functional Interface = an interface with exactly one abstract method (SAM =
Single Abstract Method).
 Used for lambda expressions.
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Example:
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunc {
void print(); // single abstract method
}
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 If you add another abstract method:
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunc {
void print();
void show(); // 􎆡 ERROR - more than one abstract method
}
Compiler will give error: "Invalid '@FunctionalInterface' annotation; MyFunc is not a
functional interface"
Summary
Functional interfaces must have only one abstract method. Adding more breaks the
contract.
4. What if we remove @FunctionalInterface annotation?
Explanation
 The @FunctionalInterface annotation is only a marker for compile-time
checking.
 If you remove it:
 interface MyFunc {
 void print();
 void show(); // 􈄥􍿁 No error, because it's now a normal interface
 }
 Without annotation, you can create multiple abstract methods → but then it’s not
a functional interface (so you can’t use lambda expressions).
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Example:
interface MyFunc {
void print();
void show(); // allowed, but no longer lambda-friendly
}
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// 􎆡 This won’t work:
// MyFunc f = () -> System.out.println("Hello");
}
}
Summary
 With @FunctionalInterface → compiler enforces one abstract method.
 Without annotation → interface can have multiple abstract methods, but no
lambda support.
􈄥􍿁 So final takeaways:
1. Migration: event-driven, parallel, per-service DBs.
2. Thread lifecycle: NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → WAITING/TIMED_WAITING
→ TERMINATED.
3. Functional Interface: only one abstract method allowed.
4. Removing @FunctionalInterface: no error, but loses lambda usability.
QUESTIONS ASKED IN LTIMINDTREE 2ND ROUND :
Q1 you have a list of users , filter users based on location and then return only 5 out
of 50 attributes which are in the user class namely
name,dept,salary,city,maritalstatus
q2 you have to read all files of all folders and subfolders in a drive using java , so
what simple method will you follow
In Java, you can solve this in two common ways:
􈄥􍿁 1. Recursive Approach (Simple and Intuitive)
You use File API (java.io.File) and recursively visit each subfolder.
import java.io.File;
public class FileTraversal {
public static void listAllFiles(String path) {
File folder = new File(path);
// If path is a directory, loop inside
if (folder.isDirectory()) {
File[] files = folder.listFiles();
if (files != null) {
for (File file : files) {
if (file.isDirectory()) {
// Recursive call for subfolder
listAllFiles(file.getAbsolutePath());
} else {
// Print file path
System.out.println(file.getAbsolutePath());
}
}
}
}
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Suppose we want to traverse D:\ drive
listAllFiles("D:\\");
}
}
􊼡 How it works:
 listAllFiles() takes a path.
 If it finds a directory → it calls itself recursively.
 If it finds a file → prints/uses it.
 This way, it visits every file in every folder/subfolder.
􈄥􍿁 2. Using Files.walkFileTree (Modern, NIO API)
Java NIO provides a cleaner way.
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes;
public class WalkFileTreeExample {
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
Path start = Paths.get("D:\\");
Files.walkFileTree(start, new SimpleFileVisitor<Path>() {
@Override
public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) {
System.out.println(file.toAbsolutePath());
return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
}
});
}
}
􊼡 Advantages:
 Built-in traversal, no manual recursion.
 You can add filters (e.g., only .txt files).
 Handles symbolic links, cycles, and large directories better.
Q3 in a microservice, a user client can access a service only if department is from
HR department, so how do I ensure this and we cannot send the department name
in the header
ChatGPT said:
Ah nice real-world style question 􋜜􋜝􋜡􋜢􋜞􋜟􋜠
Here the problem is:
 You want to restrict access → only users from HR can access a given
microservice.
 You cannot rely on headers to pass department name (since headers can be
faked / changed by client).
This is really a security + authorization design question.
􈄥􍿁 Step 1: Don’t trust client input
Never let the client say “I am HR” in the request header — that’s insecure.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 Instead, the authentication system (e.g., Keycloak, OAuth2, JWT) should
embed the user’s role/department in a token.
􈄥􍿁 Step 2: Use JWT / OAuth2 Tokens with Claims
 When the user logs in (via Auth Server like Keycloak/Okta/Spring Security
OAuth2), the token generated (JWT) contains claims like:
 {
 "sub": "user123",
 "name": "John Doe",
 "department": "HR",
 "roles": ["USER", "HR_ACCESS"]
 }
 This claim is signed by the auth server → cannot be tampered by client.
􈄥􍿁 Step 3: Enforce Department Restriction in Service
Now, inside your microservice (Spring Boot):
􊼡 Security Config (Spring Security + JWT)
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
http
.authorizeRequests()
.antMatchers("/hr/**").hasAuthority("HR_ACCESS") // only HR can access
.anyRequest().authenticated()
.and()
.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt(); // use JWT validation
}
}
􊼡 Custom Department Check
If you want finer control (check claim department=HR):
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/hr")
public class HRController {
@GetMapping("/data")
public String getHRData(@AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt) {
String dept = jwt.getClaim("department");
if (!"HR".equals(dept)) {
throw new AccessDeniedException("Only HR department allowed!");
}
return "HR Confidential Data";
}
}
􈄥􍿁 Step 4: Summary of Flow
1. User logs in → Auth server checks credentials & issues JWT with department
info.
2. Client calls HR microservice → Sends token in Authorization: Bearer <token>.
3. Microservice validates token → Extracts claims, ensures department = HR.
4. Access granted if claim matches.
􋜜􋜝􋜡􋜢􋜞􋜟􋜠 Why is this better?
 Secure → Department info comes from auth server, not client.
 No need to send department explicitly in header → token carries it.
 Scalable → Same pattern works for roles, regions, permissions.
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 In interviews, you can say:
"I’ll enforce department-based authorization via JWT claims or role-based access
control managed by an Identity Provider (Keycloak/Okta). The department is
embedded in the token, verified by microservice, not passed by client headers."
Q) in how many ways can you call a url in a microservices architechture
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􈸀􈸁
When someone asks this in a microservices interview, they usually want to test if
you understand the di􀆯erent entry points and patterns of communication
between clients and microservices.
Here’s a clear breakdown:
􊼡 1. Direct Service Call
 Definition: Client calls a microservice URL directly using its IP/port.
 Example:
 http://serviceA:8080/api/users
 Issues: Tight coupling, clients need to know service location, hard to scale.
 Use Case: Rare, maybe in internal POCs or very small systems.
􊼡 2. Through API Gateway (Most common)
 Definition: All client requests go through an API Gateway (like Zuul, Spring
Cloud Gateway, Kong, Apigee).
 Example:
 http://api-gateway.company.com/users
Gateway forwards this internally to serviceA.
 Benefits:
o Centralized authentication, rate limiting, logging.
o Clients don’t need to know actual service URLs.
o Helps versioning & routing.
 Use Case: Production-grade microservices system.
􊼡 3. Service Discovery + Load Balancer
 Definition: Services register themselves in Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper, etc.
Client uses service name, not IP. Load balancing handled internally.
 Example (Spring Cloud):
 http://serviceA/api/users
Here, serviceA is resolved via service registry.
 Use Case: Internal service-to-service communication.
􊼡 4. Asynchronous Messaging
 Definition: Instead of calling a URL synchronously, services communicate via
Kafka, RabbitMQ, or ActiveMQ.
 Example: User service publishes event → Order service consumes → Payment
service continues.
 Benefit: Loose coupling, resiliency, no waiting.
 Use Case: Event-driven systems (e.g., e-commerce order flow).
􊼡 5. gRPC / Binary Protocol Calls
 Definition: Instead of REST URLs, services communicate using gRPC (Protocol
Bu􀆯ers).
 Example:
 service UserService {
 rpc GetUser(UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
 }
 Benefits: Faster, strongly typed contracts, supports streaming.
 Use Case: High-performance microservices (fintech, gaming, IoT).
􊼡 6. Internal/Private Gateway or Service Mesh
 Definition: Inside Kubernetes, services can call each other via Istio/Linkerd
service mesh or Ingress Controller.
 Example:
 http://user-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/api/users
 Benefits: Security, observability, tra􀆯ic routing policies.
 Use Case: Enterprise-grade deployments with Kubernetes.
in addition to the general ways (browser, curl, Postman, etc.), in Spring Boot you’ll
typically use:
 RestTemplate (older, synchronous, blocking calls)
 RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
 String result = restTemplate.getForObject("http://orders-service/orders/1",
String.class);
 WebClient (newer, reactive, non-blocking)
 WebClient webClient = WebClient.create();
 String result = webClient.get()
 .uri("http://orders-service/orders/1")
 .retrieve()
 .bodyToMono(String.class)
 .block();
 Feign Client (declarative REST client)
 @FeignClient(name = "orders-service")
 public interface OrderClient {
 @GetMapping("/orders/{id}")
 OrderDto getOrder(@PathVariable("id") Long id);
}
􊵓􊵔􊵕􊵖 Summary
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 You can call a URL in microservices architecture in these main ways:
1. Direct Call (IP/Port)
2. API Gateway (recommended for external clients)
3. Service Discovery (Eureka/Consul)
4. Asynchronous Messaging (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
5. gRPC (instead of REST URLs)
6. Service Mesh / Ingress Controller
7. Resttemplate or webclient
Q)you want to give access to only 2 services out of 4 to a user, how will you do that
ChatGPT said:
Good one 􈸀􈸁 This is a microservices authorization scenario.
We want a user to access only 2 out of 4 services.
􈄥􍿁 How to implement this
1. Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
o When a user logs in, your Identity Provider (IdP) (e.g., Keycloak, Okta,
Auth0, Spring Security with JWT) issues a JWT token with
roles/permissions inside it.
o Example:
o {
o "sub": "user123",
o "roles": ["HR", "Finance"]
o }
o In your services, you configure access rules.
 Service A & B → allowed for role "HR".
 Service C & D → not allowed.
In Spring Boot (with Spring Security):
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/serviceA")
public class ServiceAController {
@GetMapping("/data")
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('HR')") // only HR role can access
public String getData() {
return "Service A Data";
}
}
2. API Gateway Layer Authorization
o Instead of checking in every service, enforce it once at the API Gateway.
o API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, NGINX, Apigee) inspects
the JWT token → only routes requests to Service A and B if user has correct
role.
o This way, user doesn’t even reach Service C and D.
Example in Spring Cloud Gateway:
spring:
cloud:
gateway:
routes:
- id: service-a
uri: http://service-a:8080
predicates:
- Path=/serviceA/**
filters:
- name: JwtAuth
args:
roles: HR
Questions asked in Publicis Sapient
how do you do serialization and deserialization using simple core java
ChatGPT said:
Great question 􋜜􋜝􋜡􋜢􋜞􋜟􋜠 — let’s walk through serialization & deserialization in Core Java
step by step.
􊼡 1. What is Serialization & Deserialization?
 Serialization → Converting a Java object into a byte stream (so it can be saved to
a file, sent over network, etc.).
 Deserialization → Reconstructing the Java object back from the byte stream.
Java provides this via:
 ObjectOutputStream (for serialization)
 ObjectInputStream (for deserialization)
The class must implement Serializable marker interface.
􊼡 2. Example Code (Core Java)
Step 1: Create a Serializable Class
import java.io.Serializable;
class Employee implements Serializable {
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; // good practice
private int id;
private String name;
public Employee(int id, String name) {
this.id = id;
this.name = name;
}
@Override
public String toString() {
return "Employee{id=" + id + ", name='" + name + "'}";
}
}
Step 2: Serialization (Object → File)
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
public class SerializeDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
Employee emp = new Employee(101, "Shriyam");
FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("employee.ser");
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
out.writeObject(emp); // 􊼡 Serialize object
out.close();
fileOut.close();
System.out.println("Serialized data is saved in employee.ser");
} catch (Exception e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
}
Step 3: Deserialization (File → Object)
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
public class DeserializeDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("employee.ser");
ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);
Employee emp = (Employee) in.readObject(); // 􊼡 Deserialize object
in.close();
fileIn.close();
System.out.println("Deserialized Employee: " + emp);
} catch (Exception e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
}
UNDERSTANDING JWT+ SPRINGSECURITY +APIGATEWAY TO EXPLAIN INTERVIEWS
Let’s go step by step so you have a complete mental picture of JWT + Spring Security
flow that you can confidently explain in an interview and also apply in your project.
􊼡 1. The Full JWT Authentication Flow in Spring Security
1. User sends login request (/authenticate) → with username & password.
2. AuthenticationManager validates credentials (using UserDetailsService).
3. If valid → generate JWT token using JwtUtil.
4. Token is returned to client → stored on frontend (localStorage / cookie).
5. On every API call, client attaches JWT in Authorization: Bearer <token>.
6. JwtFilter (a custom filter) intercepts request, validates JWT via JwtUtil.
7. If valid → set authentication in Spring Security context → Controller is executed.
8. If invalid → request is rejected with 401 Unauthorized.
􊼡 2. The Role of SecurityConfig Class
This class is the brain of Spring Security setup.
It does 3 main things:
2.1 Configure Authentication
 Define how users are authenticated:
o From DB using UserDetailsService
o Or from in-memory users (for testing)
 Register the AuthenticationManager bean.
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {
@Autowired
private JwtFilter jwtFilter;
@Bean
public AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(
AuthenticationConfiguration config) throws Exception {
return config.getAuthenticationManager();
}
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
return new BCryptPasswordEncoder(); // secure password hashing
}
}
2.2 Configure Authorization (who can access what)
 Decide which endpoints are open and which require authentication.
 Example: /authenticate (login) should be public, but /orders should be secure.
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
http.csrf().disable()
.authorizeHttpRequests()
.requestMatchers("/authenticate").permitAll() // open endpoint
.anyRequest().authenticated() // all others need token
.and()
.sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
// Stateless → no session, only JWT
http.addFilterBefore(jwtFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
return http.build();
}
2.3 Attach JWT Filter into Security Chain
 By default, Spring checks username/password with sessions.
 But since we’re using JWT, we plug in our JwtFilter.
 This filter runs before the request hits the controller.
http.addFilterBefore(jwtFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
This ensures that:
 Token is validated
 Authentication is set in SecurityContext
 Only then does request proceed to the Controller.
􊼡 3. The JwtFilter (Custom Filter)
This class reads the JWT from the request, validates it using JwtUtil, and sets
authentication into the Spring Security Context.
@Component
public class JwtFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
@Autowired
private JwtUtil jwtUtil;
@Autowired
private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;
@Override
protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request,
HttpServletResponse response,
FilterChain chain)
throws ServletException, IOException {
String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");
String token = null;
String username = null;
// Extract token
if (authHeader != null && authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
token = authHeader.substring(7);
username = jwtUtil.extractUsername(token);
}
// Validate token & set authentication
if (username != null && SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() ==
null) {
UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username);
if (jwtUtil.validateToken(token, userDetails.getUsername())) {
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authToken =
new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null,
userDetails.getAuthorities());
SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken);
}
}
chain.doFilter(request, response);
}
}
3.5 JWTUTIL CLASS
􊼡 The JwtUtil class (responsible for token operations)
This utility is usually your own helper class to:
 Generate token
 Extract username/roles from token
 Validate token
@Component
public class JwtUtil {
private String secret = "mySecretKey"; // should be in config
private long expiry = 1000 * 60 * 60; // 1 hour
// Generate token
public String generateToken(String username) {
return Jwts.builder()
.setSubject(username)
.setIssuedAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()))
.setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + expiry))
.signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, secret)
.compact();
}
// Extract username
public String extractUsername(String token) {
return Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(secret)
.parseClaimsJws(token)
.getBody()
.getSubject();
}
// Validate token
public boolean validateToken(String token, String username) {
return username.equals(extractUsername(token)) && !isTokenExpired(token);
}
private boolean isTokenExpired(String token) {
return Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(secret)
.parseClaimsJws(token)
.getBody()
.getExpiration()
.before(new Date());
}
}
􊼡 4. Putting It All Together (Interview-Friendly Explanation)
If asked “How did you implement JWT authentication in your project?” → You can
say:
􈷚􈷛􈷜􈷝 “We used Spring Security with JWT in a stateless manner. We built an authentication
API where the user sends credentials. If valid, we generate a JWT token using a JwtUtil
class. On every subsequent request, the token is sent in the Authorization header. A
custom JwtFilter intercepts the request, validates the token, and sets authentication in
the Spring Security context. Our SecurityConfig class defines which endpoints are
public, which require authentication, and integrates the filter into the security chain.
This way, we avoid using sessions and achieve stateless, scalable security across our
microservices.”
􈄥􍿁 Now you know:
 AuthController → handles login
 JwtUtil → generates & validates tokens
 JwtFilter → intercepts & validates requests
 SecurityConfig → configures everything together
ok now I got the flow, I thing more, what will be done in addition that I want that
particular services should only be accessed by user of a particular department(like
HR), so will we do this access contril inside securityconfig or should we generate
role also inside token claims and then validate at the controller level?
ChatGPT said:
Excellent follow-up 􋜜􋜝􋜡􋜢􋜞􋜟􋜠 — this is a very real interview question (and design
decision) when applying fine-grained access control in microservices. Let’s break
it down:
􊼡 Where to enforce “only HR users can access this service?”
You essentially have two options:
Option 1: Put Department (or Role) inside JWT claims
 When generating the token → include department/role info in JWT.
 Example claim:
 {
 "sub": "john.doe",
 "role": "USER",
 "department": "HR",
 "exp": 1691234567
 }
 Now, every service can read the claim and enforce access.
Implementation:
 In JwtUtil.generateToken(), add:
claims.put("department", user.getDepartment());
AND THEN
OPTION1:CHECK THE DEPARTMENT AT THE CONTROLLER LEVEL USING
PREAUTHORIZE ANNOTATION
 @PreAuthorize is a Spring Security annotation used at the method level
(controller or service).
 It checks authorization before the method executes.
 It uses Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to evaluate conditions.
􈄥􍿁 Example 1: Role-Based Access
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@GetMapping("/admin/data")
public String getAdminData() {
return "Only Admin can see this";
}
 Only users with ROLE_ADMIN authority can access.
o
or OPTION2: CHECK THE DEPT AT THE API GATEWAY LEVEL
􊼡 2. Role-Based Checking at API Gateway Level
Now, instead of writing security logic in every microservice, you can centralize it in the
API Gateway (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway, Zuul, Kong, or Nginx with JWT plugin).
􈄥􍿁 Approach: JWT Validation at Gateway
1. Client → sends JWT in Authorization header.
2. Gateway intercepts request.
3. Gateway:
o Validates JWT signature.
o Extracts claims (role, department).
o Decides whether to forward request or reject.
􈄥􍿁 Example with Spring Cloud Gateway
Create a custom filter in Gateway to validate roles:
@Component
public class JwtAuthFilter implements GatewayFilter {
@Autowired
private JwtUtil jwtUtil;
@Override
public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {
String authHeader =
exchange.getRequest().getHeaders().getFirst(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION);
if (authHeader == null || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
exchange.getResponse().setStatusCode(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
return exchange.getResponse().setComplete();
}
String token = authHeader.substring(7);
Claims claims = jwtUtil.validateToken(token);
String role = claims.get("role", String.class);
String dept = claims.get("department", String.class);
// Reject if not HR trying to access /hr/**
if (exchange.getRequest().getPath().toString().startsWith("/hr/") &&
!"HR".equals(dept)) {
exchange.getResponse().setStatusCode(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN);
return exchange.getResponse().setComplete();
}
return chain.filter(exchange);
}
}
After validating claims in the gateway, you configure routing rules (via application.yml or
Java DSL). If validation passes, chain.filter(exchange) forwards the request to the
corresponding microservice. Optionally, we can add claims to request headers so
downstream services can also enforce additional checks.”
􈄥􍿁 Benefits of Doing at Gateway
 Centralized security → microservices don’t need to re-check JWT.
 Lightweight services → no duplicate logic.
 Faster fail → unauthorized requests blocked before hitting services.
􊼡 Flow Recap
1. Client → sends JWT in Authorization header.
2. Gateway:
o Validates JWT (signature + expiration).
o Extracts claims (role, department).
o Decides: allow or block.
3. If allowed → forward request to the backend service.
o Gateway handles the routing transparently (you don’t need to re-add
claims manually unless services need them).
􊼡 Routing Configuration in Gateway
You configure service routing in application.yml (or Java DSL).
Example:
spring:
cloud:
gateway:
routes:
- id: hr-service
uri: lb://HR-SERVICE # Eureka/Consul service discovery
predicates:
- Path=/hr/**
- id: finance-service
uri: lb://FINANCE-SERVICE
predicates:
- Path=/finance/**
